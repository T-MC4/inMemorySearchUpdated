[{"pageContent":"Yeah, pretty much.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Consulting.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, it all depends on the job. It depends on what we do. And also it depends on if we sell insurance policies or whatever. It could be anything from 10,000.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Firstly wait, I didnt hear you too well. What did you say?","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, it is.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I see what youre saying. Well, right now, let me tell you, our budget is not huge. Ill tell you that right now. Its just not huge at this moment.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Well, we consult small businesses. Under 300 employees, actually, under 500 employees. And we work with family owned businesses, and we cover all the areas of finance, secession, risk management, pretty much all gambit.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I have three.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"What we do is more for a larger business. And we specialize in family owned business because they have a different dynamics than a corporate run business. So we specialize. I got a background, working with family and blah, blah, blah. So thats a little bit more tailored to that family, to that family run business, because its just different dynamics. But a lot of these family businesses are multimillion dollar businesses.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Now, theres a big trend to turn over the business to the family. That gets very complicated. So we go in and we look at all the situations and say, hey, are you covered well in these areas? And if theyre not, then we present them solution. If not, then thats fine. If they dont want to do it, but you know what I mean? We look at all the different holes in the boat and we try to plug them up. And if they want to do it, fine. If they dont, thats okay. But we usually go in there to do something, like I said, succession planning or family dynamics, some issues. So we go in to do that. At the same time, we assess other areas.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"That doesnt tell me anything. I know what AI is and I dont know what software is going to do.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"I just got on the phone with you, so I already told you a lot. I understand where youre coming from. Were fine. I dont know what you have in mind, but were okay and we can scale it. Right now, were just putting things together. So its not like were out there. Were like sailing and theres no wind. Were not in opposition. We just finished a few things and were working on some other things. I have people working on some other things.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I still dont understand. First of all, I dont understand your model. I understand that. And again, Im always curious to get this, so I dont know how you do its. Phone calls. I dont know if we pay you. You do the phone calls and you bring us the leads. Theres not too many ways to skin a cat in this industry. So basically, what do you guys offer? Listen, Ive been around the block, so I suspect what you offer, if its a good bang for the buck, its not going to be cheap. Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"We basically have all the software and technology that we need. The rest is cost of what we charge the client, and they also pay some expenses. So thats pretty much net to get realistic.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Lets have an seven.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, Im looking for help, but I dont know where you guys going with this, and I dont know where were going with this financial thing.","metadata":{"fillerID":38,"fillerText":"Ummm yah","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Thats a really good let me tell you something. Not to let the cat out of the bag, but its extremely doable. Right now. We have people putting programs together and all this kind of stuff, but we just need to tap in. Not that many clients, believe it or not, because realistically, if youre selling this.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right. First of all, where are we going with this? So, yeah, I take it. Your software is not cheap.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Man, I dont even know who you are. Listen, so what are we getting? Were going to apply for some credit to use that, to leverage that, to get this thing going. Is that what it is?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Again, I dont know why in my business, in this business, thats not a huge factor. Of course, if you had 100,000 to put in marketing, youre going to make it work. Listen, my friend, Ive been around the block a few times, and I know you could throw a million dollars in marketing, and youll get results. I know if you throw half a million dollars, you get results. I get all that. And the point is, its not necessarily true all the time. There are companies that very little.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"They make good money. Our business is high profit, and it scales according to the quality of the customer you have. So can I get to 100,000 in one month with one customer? Absolutely. Is it very doable? Extremely doable. Okay. But right now, were just starting to get traction, so I dont need 100 customers.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. Well, when I say ten, thats the profit you can make. But we could go in there on a $20,000 proposal and find out. They need certain policies, depending on the policies, life insurance and key man, all this bunch of stuff and the amount, but sometimes you can walk away with $100,000.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You too. All right.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Well, when I say small, I hate to use that word. Actually, were starting to use mid size, but really its going to be like 20 to 500. And the SBA considers anything under 500 small business. When we say small business, I think the average person thinks, mom and pop, we dont go that small because its.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, we just started cranking up actually, this new model that we have, we just started cranking up in the last three months. So revenue? I dont know, about 20,000, 30,000. Were looking to gear it up. Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":6,"fillerText":"Totally","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"DonT want to grow too fast. I dont want to do sloppy work. And some of this stuff takes time. And of course Id like to have some good revenue. But if you start to grow too fast and you got to bring in new people, and then it just gets complicated. Will it change as we go on? Yeah, as long as we can contain the growth and do it properly, yeah, if we do ten, thats fine. But I dont want to go too HOGWILD and do a crappy job.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, I would say realistically, the first year, probably 2 million. Thats net. We dont have a lot of expenses.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, thats in profit, but theres a lot of variables. Theres a lot of different things that they could buy and this and that. Its pretty powerful. But again, we put this model together for that particular reason, and so now we just need to get out there in traction. You just happen to catch me at the right time.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, the revenue I said 2 million. Well, I dont want to slam.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"We all have different capacities. Certain ones have certain skills. One is insurance, and another one is in finance. Banking? Finance, loans. Im more of the project manager overall. Project manager. I have other skill sets, too, but basically I kind of oversee everything thats going on.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, we offer consulting, but at the same time, if they need insurance, wed sell it to them.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No, it wasnt a goal from 166. Im just saying that the capacity is it really depends on the deal. Its really hard to structure because its just across the board. Its not a template that you say its 1020. It really depends on everybodys different. Its almost like a fingerprint. Companies are similar, but their needs they can have a family dynamic situation. They can have an operation situation.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"We dont go in there to sell insurance. We dont go in there to sell insurance. The reason we teamed up with it, with that value proposition, is because 60% of the companies out there, as a fact, dont have a lot of this stuff. And I personally know that when I was a kid, my dad passed away. We had two companies, and he didnt have chemo. The company suffered a great deal. So theres a lot of experience in there that we go in there and we look at their operation, lets say, or family dynamics or a particular situation or succession.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Well, why does that play in this? I dont understand.","metadata":{"fillerID":26,"fillerText":"Ummm yah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know, a week ago?","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Not even 16. It could be eight. Thats what Im trying to tell you, is that they buy insurance policies. And those policies, they pay the agents very good commissions because every company has to generally have key man insurance. I dont know if you know what that is, but key man is like the president or the vice president. Depending on the size of the company, they may have a million, $2 million policy on that person. Something happens to that person, the company gets $2 million to help deal with the transition, because a lot of times its a big transition. So theres actually multiple policies and things that are sold, and they offer very good commissions. Health care. If they buy into health care, we do their health care. That could pay anywhere from $100 to $200,000.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Well, weve been doing it what happened is we merged at another company that we just did that. Now were offering insurance policies and things like that. So we merged with another company that was formed, but Ive been doing it 30 years. 40 years? Yeah, on the consulting side, but on a different capacity. We were actually subcontracted most of the time, but now we kind of went on our own.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}}]
