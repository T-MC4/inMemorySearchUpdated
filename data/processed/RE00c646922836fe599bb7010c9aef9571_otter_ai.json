How many what?","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"Its about like 700.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"With my business or just my corporate America job?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, its a coaching and consulting business, and I guess my title is a pageant consultant. So my niche is pageantry, and the services that I offer are for pageantry, such as my public speaking and interviewing program. Its called get the crown power. I have my Get the Crown Pageant Competition VIP Support Program, and thats somebody that I help them from the beginning to the end of the whole pageant journey. Right. Im their personal consultant. I also offer social media management. Again, everything is for my pageant beauties. However, I begin to see other companies that kind of are reaching out to me, mainly for my social media because I do have really good skills, and I was the number one marketer, so that might be somewhere you guys can help me grow as well. To be honest, the reason why Im reaching out for assistance is because its hard to focus on my business because I still do have a nine to five working for the CDC, and my goal is to leave that this year. So I want to be able to grow my business so that I dont have to worry about my corporate America job, if that makes sense.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"This is how I know its powerful. I did that on my own. No marketing besides running my ads and stuff, creating ads and putting them on TikTok. That is how I got my clients. Thats how I made $8,350.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"15,000. Okay, so thats your goal, and thats what you think you can attain if people could afford your services?","metadata":{"fillerID":7,"fillerText":"Yah totally","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You know what it is? I do not want to force them. I could, you know what I mean? I could do that and get them to actually do the program, but I really dont want to force or I really dont want to. Like, for example, Ill give you an example of this. When I was starting out in my coaching business, right? And I was just trying to figure out if I was doing something correctly and there was a coach that was like, oh, Ill help you, blah, blah. And so she made it seem like it was an urgent concern for me to enroll in something. So I paid the money and it turns out nothing she taught me was what I was using, programs, everything. So the fact that she was urgent to try to get somebody just so she can make money, I never want to be that type of person. So yes, I could be stronger, but I didnt want to because I knew she had kids, especially the client I was talking to. And I knew that she wanted the service, but I just dont want to take money from her kids. Im a trained social worker, so I think of it that way.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I want to learn more about it and how it can grow my business.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"We could do 01:00 p.m. 01:00 p.m.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Would that be Central Standard Time or Eastern?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"But like, your for my business, I made 8300. And last year, my corporate America job, my salary is $96,000.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"My personal one or business?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Go here and get your clients. That is going to be helpful.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I would say 50 or less. People show. Up.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay? Thank you.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Just to be on the safe side, maybe I could put towards 5000 just to start a little bit and then maybe another 5000 when its moving forward.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I work nine to five, but in the mornings thats pretty easy for me to maneuver and take phone calls.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Actually, Ive been thinking about maybe joining, partnering with a merchant service where a firm, or what is it called, a firm and some other things. Some of the company where the clients can enroll in that and they pay me, but the client decides like if they got a monthly payment or six months payment plan or a year payment plan. So theyve already paid me.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No, Wednesday morning actually we have a conference call. Wednesday afternoon would be probably better.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Hello?","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"With people, so just to repeat everything, watch the video, and then Ill have a phone call. But is it going to be a phone call where its just on the phone like I am with you, or is it like a zoom conference?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, so let me just bring the carriages back. I dont even know if thats the right way to say it. Let me just synopsis this here. Youve got the pedigree, obviously, you got the history, youve got the results, which is really what its all about. I mean, obviously not the public speaking and everything, but like the actual whole package. You get the results with the people who utilize your services. Okay. You think that you could take this to the moon if you could do it, if things were set up? And most importantly, if you were able to target people who could afford your services, like, say people could afford your services, how much and I want a real introspective number here. Whats your goal per month to be able if you were able to streamline this and have a better front end sales process that circumvents potentially that third party, and people could afford your services without you changing your price? How much would be your goal to make per month that you think is actually attainable right now?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, my coworker left the job, so I am doing everything right. Yes, its really tough. Its really tough today. Im glad you called me late because I just got off even though I was remotely I just got off doing the things that I and so it doesnt leave me enough time to really focus on my business. So far, within my business, Ive only seen three people. Right. Well, you know what? Let me take that back. Ive seen 30 total, but 30 the 20 is through Pageant Planner. So I have a subscription based on Pageant Planner there where they pay me to see the client, but its a fee. Its like a captive managed care. Its a predetermined rate to give me being able to coach the client. So its not my fees, its the fees that theyre paying for Pageant Planner, and then they pay me. So Ive seen about like 40, 50 clients. However, my clients alone only five.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. If I got one client, let me tell you, for the social media one, Ive had five clients in there, but I only work with them for a month, so I charge them 500 for my five clients that I have in that, and theyre really pretty much savvy. They just wanted to know the apps that I use. Right. So I just trained them a little bit on that and stuff. Theres a company that Im actually trying to get on board because Im going to do the SEO for them. Im going to do all of that. So one client of that, Ill be okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right, you too.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Sales calls a month? Five.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Cynthia Apia.","metadata":{"fillerID":41,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Is that something that is sent to the email and then you can watch that?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, Im in Central. Wednesday at four. Oh, no, wait, I forgot. I sell life insurance as well. And theres an event there, so go there. Lets see. Okay. What are your times on Wednesday? What else besides the morning and besides 400? You said three, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, and you know what? Im going to tell a little story about this. So Im a little jaded too, because last month, like I said, I made the 8000 something on my own accord, working the evening hours of my corporate America job, doing everything on my own, creating my flyers, whatever. And so this last month, I said, oh, let me hire a marketing company, even though I could do this myself. But I thought it would be easier to have another person come on board to do it for me so I dont have to worry about that, right? And they said, yeah, we can do email marketing for you and I guarantee youre going to have clients and stuff like that. And Im thinking, okay, maybe at most five clients. That should be easy. They ran the email campaign. Nobody. And so I told them, I said, Ive done email campaigns before. Check if it was actually sent successfully or the click rate or whatever. And theyre like, oh, no, we did everything, blah, blah, blah. Turns out the click rate was only 0.2.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, thats true. So itll probably be like 100.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"If it was that social media that social media thing alone is eight K a month, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im saying $100,000 a month, not like, salary a month.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, you did?","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"How are you?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, that is it.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"They dont want to yeah. Like, to cut you off. Yes, it makes sense. Now, my question is for you, in an effort to grow this I dont know this answer, so thats why Im asking both sides. Would it be, in theory, more beneficial for you to do like you said, youve done ads to do an ad campaign just for your services instead of having to go through a middleman or I dont know that answer. With your fees and everything, would it be beneficial for you to be on your own and use your reputation that you have already? And again, I dont know that answer, so thats why Im asking.","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Sure.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, it makes sense. My goal is getting five clients a month is fine. If I was only charging $500, I probably would have so many clients already. But I cant do that because first of all, rent is expensive, right? What Im taking home from my corporate America job, I have to make about the same amount bringing in the clients in order to because I have to pay for my health insurance. So when I designed the program, I was like, okay, realistically for me to live here in Dallas, Texas, where I am, how much would I be able to afford? And it has to be $3,000 for my rent. Half of that is gone already for rent if Im not including my corporate America job.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im going to use that trademark.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Just listening to the phone call and seeing what could happen afterwards.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, I was going to use my 401, you know what I mean? I actually talked to them and I said because my goal is leaving my job. Thats an adamant goal. That is something I want to do for real. And I was even thinking maybe I should get a job as a senior marketing manager just to switch over because I still do marketing. That is something that I love doing and creating stuff. I love creating things. So I was like, maybe that might be easier because they would be paying my salary would be a little higher if I got a marketing job than what Im making now and still being able to work on my business. Im in between because I dont know what I should do, like put in my resignation and then Ill be able to take my 401 and put it into my business. But then my concern is if I put that money into my business, Im hoping that Im getting clients and money is coming in. And like you said, theres no money coming in yet. I might be getting the client tomorrow, who knows? Its not a guarantee. And then for example, yesterday I talked to someone and I showed her my presentation for the public speaking and she was really and then I said my price. Shes like, oh, she joined my newsletter or whatever. But she obviously afford it. She liked the presentation and everything but she wasnt and she just joined my newsletter maybe. I know in sales I did really well and people would never buy that day, but they will always come back and buy, I know maybe in six months time shell come back, be like, you know what, Im ready, I got the money. And I never force anybody. I just tell them the right things about how its going to solve their problem and if they see that as a benefit, then they will always come back.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I will be traveling all over the world. Honestly, Im doing this my business. There are three parts to my business and my real goal, even though Im seeing my clients and everything, to have my luxury fashion brand. Right. Ive already talked to designers and everything like that. I sold my stuff, and they told me how much it was going to be to get it off the ground. So my goal was I didnt want to stay in a corporate America job while still developing my fashion line, because Ive already created my design. I just need production now, and the production is going to cost a lot of money once thats produced my fashion line and everything like that. So my goal was moving for my corporate America job, focusing on my coaching clients. That allows me the flexibility to even enhance my fashion line, if that makes sense.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. I think for me, as Im looking at all this and really doing a SWOT analysis on everything, all I need is just the capital to push me forward. Thats all really what I need. Once the capital is there, my structure and the system will be strengthened. Right now, its a little wobbly because I dont have that and Im depending on a fixed job. So I think once I leave that job and I have the capital coming in, I can only grow it more. So for me, being aware of what I need and stuff like that, thats why the coaching last time when I paid for the coaching, it didnt work for me because I already know what I need to do and what I need to do works out better than what they taught me. Sure, yeah. I always tell my clients, Come on board. Im like, if you are a person who is self aware, who is very confident and understands what they have to do, coaching might not be the best avenue for you because you already know what you have to do. For me, all I know is the capital and maybe the best avenue. I did have somebody reach out to me for, maybe I should just apply for a loan. I just didnt want to go that route. But after were talking, I think maybe thats all I need.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Honestly, I just need a strategic way of leaving my corporate America job where Im getting clients consistently. I dont think I need all the other pieces as theyre going to talk about like, oh, how to do this, how to do that. Im pretty sure Im savvy to do all of that. I just need to know how to get my five clients consistently. Thats really it. And also being able to being able to really fully transition into my corporate America job. Or for example, I put in my resignation maybe the end of May and then by tomorrow I get a client, two clients. Thats really what I need because my 401K is going to help me for a while. Ill be able to pay my rent for a while. So thats really what I need. The strategy there, the system there. I have an idea on it, but I dont know if the call is going to really help me per se.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No. Again, just to restate. The call is free. I dont have to pay anything for that call?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"So that means they did something off. And then so I got upset and I was like, you know what? I wasted my money. I paid you a lot of money. And you guys told me I was going to get at least one or two three clients and nothing. And running a business, you cant just throw out money like that. So I was really upset, especially I know that I could do better. I took the leads that I purchased from them and I ran my own campaign. And it turns out the leads that I bought from them, a majority of their emails were incorrect.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"No, I understand.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"ItS less than that, actually. I would say, like 20%.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Maybe like a month ago.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"No. So Pageant Planet is a platform for judges, pageant coaches, and Im a judge and a coach and a recruiter for the pageant system. And they have a certain amount of clients that come to you and say, hey, you know what? I want to work for Cynthia to be my coach or whatever. So they pay me for the clients that I coach. So its like a set rate that they give me per month for being able to coach the clients. So, for example, Ill give you an example of that. One of the clients actually started following me on Instagram. She was like, oh, my God, Cynthia, I dont want to go with any other coach because you really coached me the way I need to be coached. And so shes like, well, can I become your client? I said, of course. And then I gave her my fees. Shes like, oh. So its like they give you leads there, but the leaves dont want to pay anything other than what pageant plan is allowing. Does that make sense?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. So for my Get the Crown Power program, its a three month program for public speaking, Poise and everything. Thats $3,000. My Get the Crown VIP program that helps them through their whole page. In Germany, Im their personal consultant. Thats 5000. And my social media there are different prices. So if they want me to just train them on how to be great like me doing their social media 2500, if they want me to just create their content for them, I have packages for just creating their content, as in their flyers, branding it with their brand logo and stuff like that on there. Or if they want me to manage their account, running their daily stories, creating content for their fees and their daily stories. That is $8,000 per month. Ive been selling the training program and not so much the management one, because people want that, but they say they cant afford it. So thats the challenge there. So really what Im looking for are people that can actually high value clients. And Ive gotten high value clients with my pageant business. Every month, I see like, two people of my pageant consultants. They even found me on TikTok or LinkedIn and stuff like that. Or sometimes I run ads. So I know that Ive been successful to get that, but maybe on a larger scale and on a consistent basis is what Im looking for.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}}]
