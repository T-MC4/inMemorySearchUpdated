So I have ten years to utilize and leverage money so my wife can retire and I retire. And we have to have an income stream, whether thats property or something that allows us to not work into our 70s. Right. The retirement age is only going to increase. Our government is not going to be able to pay out the Social Security, and its already increased, so its probably going to increase the 70 by the time Im able to retire. So I dont want to depend on the government. Id rather be able to make appropriate investments so we control that, not the government.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You said you sent an email to me.

We are pretty strapped, so we make too much that we cant deduct things nor invest into basic investment plans. And so Im looking at different ways that I can do that. And based on our income level, we dont have the money to continue to invest in those things. So Im trying to see if I can leverage your money a different way.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Well, its just more continue to utilize that money for family as well as additional investments, whether that means property, whether that means just necessities. My wife and I both work, but we have good paying jobs, but its still with our boys education and whatnot all of our money is going to that and we cant save.

So right now we make so much money that I cant put more money to Roth IRA. Right now, Roth IRAs are useless to us. Now theres other investment things whether thats a whole life policy. Well, we dont have the money to go into a whole life policy where we can utilize the cash value to invest in properties because Id rather be doing stuff that tangibles than dealing with the stock market. Id rather have something that gains compound interest in a whole life policy as well as I can borrow from that whole life policy. And whether its take a loan from that to pay off boys college or fix our home, invest in other property, whatever it might be. But we just dont have the money to do that. So I need second stream of money so we can create those investment streams right. Versus borrowing from the bank. And right now, its not really easy to borrow from the bank.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}}]
