[{"pageContent":"Makes sense to me. No worries. I just thought maybe you had a ballpark, but its no worries. Either way, I want to know about it because it looks like AI is getting ready to take over. So we need to be moving with the time, right? Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yes. So Im not sure what time or if hes off. I can find out in a few minutes because Im literally getting ready to pick him up, but Im not sure if hes off on Tuesday. But he has a business of his own that your services may benefit him as well. But Im not sure how it may be, not because hes in the logistics business.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im in agreement that time is valuable. One of the worst things I hate is not being able to have my client show up when Ive taken my time. I even say reminders prior to just to make sure that they plan on showing up to the call because Ive had calls where Im sitting there for 30 minutes and they never come. Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. A call is cool. Im cool with that.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"So I live in Orlando, Florida.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, theyre calling, theyre texting and I know its from you all because theyre texting. Theyre even calling me on WhatsApp, like four or five different numbers. Ive been getting text messages since last night about this AI. I dont mind getting calls because I actually initiated contact with you all. And obviously when I put in my phone number and email, Ive given consent for contact. But if it would just be respectful and just contact during daytime and not 1030 12:00 at night, it will be greatly appreciated.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Thats only on Monday? Yeah, thats only on Monday.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So this might be something I might be interested in because I just connected with two other lending companies. Im trying to be a marketplace funding loan broker and everybodys situation is different. And different lenders have different criteria for funding and I want to be able to meet each one of my clients at their level. Do you all have an affiliate option.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right, thank you so very much. All right, take care.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Right there before you get finished, because I want you to finish. The 1499 package, if you bought it straight from the vendor, is actually $4,000. I tried to price it where its payable, but if its doable and people are actually buying that at that price, Im sure there are, because there are people that can afford it. However, I have not come across that clientele yet.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Lets shoot for Tuesday.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Im a consultant.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, to be quite transparent, to even access this particular product, Im paying about $700 a month, and Im not even seeing that. To be quite transparent in sales, I just connected with some others that are going to join the sales team with me to try to scale this business. I know its possible. I have a corporate job, and thats been really taking a lot of my time. And then Im up late at night trying to work on this and make this profitable. But I see over the next six months. With the right guidance, I know I can be at multiple six figures on a monthly basis. Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So let me say this to you how serious I am. Ive given myself a twelve month time frame to walk away from my job and I pray I can do it in half of that. So anything you can do to help me get this going, however that looks, whatever your business can offer. I know that the item that I have is valuable. I just need the right recipe to put it in the search engine optimization, whatever I need to do for Facebook, Pixels, whatever. Ive been studying this stuff because I know its a science to it. So its just a matter of getting the right person that can marry these systems together and make it happen. I believe in it.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im sorry. You did ask that. So there are three different ways in which I price someone, and Im trying to meet every potential clients financial level. I have a four week, one on one course that will basically fast track what they would be able to do in six to nine months and four weeks at 375 with coaching, one on one sessions once a week for 375. And then we have the package where you get the actual suite. Do it yourself for 799. You still have me as a point of contact. I have the 1499 package for those clients, like other coachers, other consultants, tax preparers that want to be able to resell this themselves. So then they become a partner with me, and then I charge them a $99 a month finance fee to be able to do the application because Im being charged monthly for the software as well. But they will deal with their own clients. They would just kind of send me the information from a back end perspective, have access to that, and they kind of do what their clients so its three different packages. You have your 375, your 799, and your 1499 is obviously for the business in a bundle for those that want to be able to add this as a ala carte service to their business.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Id rather just leave that up to.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Likewise. Thank you. I look forward. Will it be a zoom or a call?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"It does. Throws your whole schedule off and everything.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Well, lets do 08:00 A.m.. 08:00 A.m..","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Im sorry. Im hard now talking, and the phone was on mute. Im sorry.

I didnt want to interrupt you while you was talking. Thats weird.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Stands currently, so I think its sitting at about 585 right now. And Im currently in the program that Im selling. They are helping me to get my business credit and my personal credit together. The sweet part that I like about what Im doing now, and I love this from that Square is doing this. The ticket items that I have, square has it now where in the payment links you can set it up for payment plans. So being able to offer that and be able to have clients to pay in installments I think is attractive. Is that something that you all have in place?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"So hes normally home? It varies because, like today, although Im getting ready to go pick him up, he has to go back in again tonight. So if we could catch let me see. Do you mind if I call him right quick and see?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, so my business is a management and consulting business. Its a plethora of things. We do payroll solutions, bookkeeping. Im offering business credit and funding. So Im a loan broker. Also we do dispatching for logistics and I just recently started Real Estate Investing.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"For sure.

Well, hes probably not going to want to get up that early on his day off, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, give me 1 second. Because he may be off work. Hold on.","metadata":{"fillerID":2,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Got you.","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Perfect. Greatly appreciate it. I look forward to hearing from your team. Thank you. What was your name, sir?","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Thats a no brainer.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So I am a morning person, but the time doesnt work for me because I have 08:30 A.m. Standing meetings every Monday morning in my corporate space. But I do get off Monday at 12:00 and Im done for the day. I dont know what that time will be for you. Are you on eastern Standard.","metadata":{"fillerID":6,"fillerText":"Totally","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So very recently Ive changed my business model to focus more on business credit and funding simply because thats the main area of need. I think its safe to say that there are a lot of businesses, but a lot of businesses fail within the first five years because we cannot get access to capital. And so the whole educational piece around that. People know they need to start developing business credit, but I think they dont really know how to stack credit and how to make themselves fundable and ready for financing. So thats been the main thing that Ive been focusing on lately. And I partnered with a finance company that has basically the whole suite already mapped out, planned out a whole software, and I did not need to reinvent that wheel. I did not select to go with their full white label package. I do have their white label package, but they would have set up my website on their end to be able to offer the actual package where it could work automated without me having to do it. So the way that Im doing it now, they can go and purchase the package, and I can set up where they can have a consultation with me before I actually physically give them the package just to kind of do my due diligence, get all of the ins and outs I need. So I kind of need that process married up and maybe put some type of photo out there. Im sorry. I hadnt had much sleep. Yeah. So if I could just kind of marry that whole process up to where I wouldnt have to manually coach these sessions if I could have them on demand webinar. So Im trying to work on that now and just kind of get the payment and everything all married up together, if that makes sense.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Hi. You all are literally low key. Youre really low key. Aggravating. Ive been getting calls and text and people are calling and hanging up and doesnt look like good business acumen. Im just going to be honest, calling.","metadata":{"fillerID":39,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Great. Likewise. Thank you so very much. Just out of curiosity, is there a website and or testimonials for your services that I can go and check out? Are they in the video?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"So once they would now thats scary too. Do you get 100% completed payments at that because now they got your product?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"As a matter of fact, I do. Hes calling right now. Hold on for 1 second. I was about to say to hold on. Give me 1 second.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yes. I got a client right now that has a food truck. Hes making forty k. Now listen to this. Hes my success story waiting to happen. I cant wait to start working with him Monday. He lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. He already has a food truck. Hes been doing it for like five years. He legitly, makes forty k a month. And guess what? He has no business credit. He has never got one dime of funding. He is a revenue financing waiting to happen.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. Me on the other hand, I work from home, so Im accessible either way. But lets do maybe around eleven. He doesnt sleep long because hes ex military, so Im sure hell be up. But just in case he wants to lounge around a little longer, I dont want to impose.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Jesus.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"No, I havent been. Ive been considering running ads to do a soft launch on the product. But again, I know that theres a science to that too. And Im just trying to make sure that I have the right wording. And now youre giving me confidence with the pricing. Because if people are paying this, where do you find most of your traffic with these high ticket clients?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, well, I cant wait to get my hands on this video because I want to see everything that it offers. I know that its going to give me everything, and I know its valuable, and I know its costly, so Im not going to be scared away from the price, but around how much is it so I can financially plan. Were in the middle of buying land and everything, so I want to make sure it makes sense right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, thats even better.","metadata":{"fillerID":6,"fillerText":"Totally","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Hi, whos this?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, sir, that is correct.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"I know its great money in this. I do know its great money. I know I could be a millionaire probably before this year is out. Its just getting the systems in place and letting them flow. So I know I got a high ticket item and its very valuable. Its just me putting it in front of the people that need it so they can get it and I can make money in my sleep.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So the fact that he has a financial ability, but he cant scale because everythings going back in the inventory for food. So to be able to give him some capital to help him scale and grow, I think its going to be beneficial. And the fact that he has the financial backing already, which is what a lot of my clients dont have. But in that same breath and in that same vein, his personal credit is not that good. Yeah, but cash collateral and credit is the three C that we go upon. Yes. So the fact he has a cash, Im already happy for him.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, Eastern Standard.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, so hes off on Tuesday.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So literally just repricing the offer. Because the offer is everything thats in it is already valued at 4000. Actually, 39 97 is what its valued at. But because Im a reseller, I get to kind of control that narrative. But if youre telling me now that in this coaching and consulting space, and I know that thats accurate, because I have one of my business coach, shes a former attorney and she has a ticket item, its $9,000, and Im willing to pay it. I just need the right clients to buy my product so I can buy her product. So I know that its possible.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Wow.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Hes got a lot of for sure. Yeah, for sure.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"With you, definitely, I want to hear about it.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. I couldnt get him to answer. Lets do this. Hes calling. Hold on.","metadata":{"fillerID":2,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, I do own a business for three years now. Im actually wanting to see how I can automate the business and see how much that will cost. Find out everything that you offer within your AI package or tool and to see if its a good fit for my business.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Oh my God.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}}]
