What sort of businesses does that are you a digital agency for, like, painting companies?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Not sure. Because once you have a number of, like, say, 30 million under management, then you have a constant inflow of money. You can just manage that. You dont have to do the marketing and do the same things you are doing currently or Im currently that allows tons of freedom. So I know financial planners are like, why would I retire? My clients own yachts and invite me out for the afternoon. I dont have any clients that own yachts right now. But that was just one of the guys, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right, right. No. Any way that I can speed things up and fill my rooms with people for my seminars? Thats obviously a good thing. My marketing kind of just, without getting into all the details of it, just fell apart the last quarter. And so Im currently going through lists that I have of people who havent showed in last meetings and whatnot, and just making phone calls to fill my own rooms without any real overhead cost and to regenerate some current cash flow. And so Im in that mode right now where I need to keep my internal costs as low as possible and still generate my high ticket item that I am able to generate but not currently able to jump into a new program. I know thats kind of you got to do something to get something. And so my do something right now is my own personal dive into my own files and create yeah, in your lane.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, right. Youre wanting to walk me through and to teach me how to become a coach or a digital marketing agency, neither one of those are my field.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. Because Ive talked to different marketers and they talk, always webinar, and theyre telling me theyre always saying its the same thing. And I know for a fact its absolutely not. Its simple to turn on and click a button and watch this thing, but to get in your car and drive out, much different animal. And Ive been told that I really should charge for my seminars because youll get a higher show rate when somebody puts even if its $20 classic 29 95 or whatever, 1995, whatever. The show ratio is much higher with that, because down the road, that could be something that I could duplicate for other financial planners, because this is my wheelhouse. I know this totally. And if I have a system thats just cranking out people to my seminars, and I have a track record of.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Go to yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.
