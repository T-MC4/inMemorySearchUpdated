[{"pageContent":"Yes. So when I went through that type form, it got to the point where it said, click here for your case study, and theres nowhere to go.

So I just scrolled through there and I saw you.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"That was the issue.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Just over three years. Okay. We are, absolutely. I say Im also dipping into AI. You obviously have been there longer, but being at the forefront of a technology thats developing like this, its a good place to be, Id say.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right. Okay, cool. All right, great. What I would like to do, I definitely want to send you over this case study. I would like to kind of keep in touch with what you guys are doing because again, with the coaching and consulting space that we are in and what weve seen, the success is phenomenal. If you have an idea in your head of what you can kind of either consult with people or teach them something. I know there are probably plenty of tools out there, like squarespace and so on. As far as building websites, have you had any pushback from people saying, hey, I can go do that myself? But I think the key is the web hosting part, that I dont know where other people would go to do that. And if you host their website, what other offerings do they get from you guys other than just it exists on your platform?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"It is an interesting time to be in this industry, Ill tell you. It is like yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, were still pulling those numbers right now. Were marking down our touch points and kind of getting an idea of kind of what that whole thing looks like. You know what I mean? A large part of our outreach is just at least just the first month has been for my first business. I have a large referral network.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Hello.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah, I think I get it. Like I say, in a way, it kind of makes sense. I think the biggest thing, as you mentioned, is getting the number. Have you run the numbers on how many businesses basically you can access, as opposed to and then also what your show rate is and what your closing rate is on that?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely. So I am the founder and CEO of Site Dreamers. So we are a Midwest based web hosting company. Essentially, our whole shtick is we build websites for free. And were in an area where we are stocked with small businesses that dont really have any sort of a web presence at all. The St. Croix Valley of eastern Wisconsin or western Wisconsin. We came up with this way of using so we currently use an AI web building platform, and we use that to build websites for companies, and then we host them on our own internal servers. And so thats kind of our thing, is we build websites for free, and then we offer a website hosting plan. Kind of like the Netflix for website hosting.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. So currently all of our clients are based out of Minnesota and Wisconsin. We just started signing clients, actually, last week. So we launched beginning of April, finished building our systems, and then we started cold calling and knocking on doors about beginning of last week. And so we got three clients in Minnesota right now, and the rest are in our town, river Falls. River Falls, Wisconsin. For us, its a pretty easy sell. So I think its not a matter of if we can make this thing big, at least in the St. Croix Valley area or surrounding greater Twin Cities area, because I think well make that happen. But after that, I think the plan site Dreamers, we completely secured that. To me, that sounds like a nationwide kind of a brand, something that people can easily recognize if we brand it correctly. So I think the goal would probably be going nationwide and doing that. The types of businesses that were doing, its literally any small business. Right?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Sorry.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"This is our first month, so me and my partner, we both have been running separate marketing agencies for the last few years, and we kind of picked up on this idea and kind of joined forces on this new company. So we started at the beginning of April.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Weve got a team of, like and Im not sure if this even answers your question, but weve got a team of four reps who are kind of working on pushing this thing so that in its own right, generates quite a bit of pull for us.

Thank you for asking. Im at the office right now, but I was inquiring about that case study.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, we do three keywords of SEO, and I would say its fairly baseline for that, but mostly its kind of like we build the website, fully design it, host it, and then all within 48 hours launch it, and then they also get a free domain with that. Its kind of the whole thing.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I appreciate it very much.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.
