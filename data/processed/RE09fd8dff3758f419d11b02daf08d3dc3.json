Its not that I dont have them, its just where they have to be allocated while I have them. And I get it month to month because its very sporadic. Ive just now done a little Facebook thing and said, you know what, let me just use my talent for myself. And I started this maybe about a month ago just to revenue generate for myself. But the biggest challenge yes, is finance. And its just really time until my damn credit goes up, and then Im going to be looking like Ive been doing this shit for 20 years, basically.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Hey, awesome hose, man.

I dont know, something other than my cell phone. But yes, Ive been using a Google voice number to dial.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right now, Im just sitting at the house, doing what I know how to do, which is all I do is I go on Facebook in the morning, start at 06:00 in the morning. I get on Facebook, I type in Realtors, I go to Pages, then I open up like 50, 60 of them, and I just start cold calling. I hit them for 199. I get like five of those a day.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"607. But I know its going up, though. Within the next month, I should have it in the seven. Im just going to add some authorized users. I have, like, 25,000 in credit card debt, 0% utilization. I just had $110,000 of debt maybe three months ago, and then I got all that not paid off, but paid off because of my car. I paid the car off. I got $87,000 of school loans removed. Shout out to Trump. Im like at ground zero at 607. I just checked today.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Annual income is about 80. 90. Okay.

No, youre good.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I got like 6000 that I could pump into the CRM, but at any given time I could just go get them by 2000 a pop. And Im literally paying maybe peanuts for them. I say free, but paying $50 to get somebody to put it into a spreadsheet so I could upload it into the CRM, they are free. But I do pay people to do that because I dont know all the technical stuff. So I just get on fiverr and hire people to do that, to be honest with you. But yeah, I have no problem with the leads. I know that at this point where Im at in this progress in process, its more like when it comes to a point where the website is done and then everything is on me, basically. So Im really focusing on maxillo, facial surgeons, dentists, dermatologists, things of that nature. And Im hitting them for like $3,000 a month, basically, because Im getting them anywhere from four to six leads a month, basically. So for them, thats $50 to $150,000 a month. I could easily ask for three K. Okay. Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, that definitely sounds like it.

I mean, Ive been piecing it together this whole time, so I can say yes. It shouldnt take that much more for me to be able to basically make some calls. And thats a matter of literally I have a desk at the house, computer headset, and a little bit of funding to just be able to sit there and dial. I mean, I got my leads, I got the CRM, I got everything. Kind of like gearing up to go. Im not waiting on them, but Im working on my credit as of right now so that theres no denials. Basically theres no denying me when I do it because Im with Navy Federal and everything, so I know I could get some funds. Its just a matter of me getting my credit up.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Michael from who?","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"150 to 200? Yeah. Youre saying because by then yes, I should have three, four. Im looking for wolves. I mean, like dogs. And once I get them in the office, I mean, me, myself, Im projecting my first month of just being up and running, save for any bumps or mistakes or just stuff I cant really account for. Im going to say probably about 20K my first month. But after that, just knowing who Im Im a master salesman, by the way, when I say master salesman, Ive been doing this for 23 years, firstly. Secondly, I master my mind. So theres no such thing as bad days, bad leads, just bad attitudes. And once I figure that out, I fucking cant lose. But once I get this together, Im telling myself Im getting one a day. I dont stop until I get one a day. So that one a day bring me three K a day. So Im looking at like 60K, maybe the second month by myself. And then from that point, Ill be looking for some commercial space, basically, to get at least five people in there. Thats really all I need.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely. Manual. This is literally just for survival in Los Angeles. I live downtown La. So thats literally just to pay the rent and be able to move around, basically. But what was your question again, if you plan on automated? Well, not quite yet because I figured out how to get free leads. Ive done a lot of help with a lot of startups here. And this one guy hired me, this company called digitalesque maybe two years ago, and he said, I hired you because you said you could lead generate, which I really did not know how to do at the time. But I sat there for an hour and I fucking figured it out, man. So now I know how to get free leads, like good ones too.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, Ive started. I mean, we started as far as LLC got proof of concept because a client fell into my lap. But Im literally building a website right now thats kind of going to be part of the close just to be all the way upfront with you. And thats going to be done within a couple of weeks here.
