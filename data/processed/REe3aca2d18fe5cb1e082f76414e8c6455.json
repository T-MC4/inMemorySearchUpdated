And so do you have scripting and training and education on how to present or close these guys down?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I can look at the biggest thing is for what I would see is really just looking at, I think in the short term, long term, if I can get this other program going up and running when I get these agents because I got a lot of agents that I could plug and play right now if we had a turnkey system. See what Im saying?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Like about 90,000.

All right.","metadata":{"fillerID":3,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I do like the where you have appointment setters that can pre screen them, and then we pay them 5% on the top of the cell for when we do make them. Most of our leads are kind of a lower ticket item, but it depends on our marketing. We can get them into high ticket sales, like our Annuities or IUL product line. Totally. Which are a lot more commissions involved. Right. If they do the marketing and theyre marketing out to do you have to do ad spends on top of that.

Mountain Time. So I could do a 03:00 would work.","metadata":{"fillerID":2,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. No, well, the cost to me, thats the cost of the list, the telemarketer, everything included. So thats basically per call now with your closing ratio, I mean, for acquisitions, probably youre probably going to go like ten of those to probably close one.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, maybe 1000.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Right, right. If the lead cost is if we keep the lead cost down where other agents are paying for life transfers already, and for that, that would make sense for them to do it. And thats how I look at it. If it competes with what Im already doing, Id have no problem making adding to what we do. You know what I mean?","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, thatd be cool. The thing is, I just dont have a lot of capital for that type of strategy.

I think the upfront money is where, as long as its something that they could come in and build it and scale it, and then I could plug my team into it. If they have the trunk yet to do it, then I would be open to it because I have a team to do it. If they have the market and the capital to get it going, then I would be willing to do it, and I could have the sales team behind it. You know what I mean?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, I like the pickup rate, but what are you guys doing for leads, though?

Thats probably one of my biggest things, that I work for two large companies recruiting their agency and building their agents, getting other IMOs to work with me. You know what I mean?

And just getting one of those relationships is worth a ton of money.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":41,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No, I can get lists for what.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Not outbound. Most of the stuff that were doing is most of the stuff were doing is either outsourcing that stuff out to telemarketers, typically to book appointments, or do you, like, transfer calls over to us?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, I guess based on what I would look at, yes. Im open to anything if theres something thats profitable and I can get these agents. Problem is, most agents, they dont have any capital to get started, right. So if you got them where they could be, just be salespeople and come in and just make commission based right. Then you need to get them in front of a ton of people every day.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Right. Yeah. And the problem is ad spends are going out and youre getting people dont pick up the phones or whatever. They dont go calendar. So youre doing a lot of drop off. The ones that do dont show. You get a lot of those issues, and then when youre trying to learn new system like that and youre not efficient with it, then it just is very expensive.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I could do, like, 09:00 or 10:00.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Do you know how many cost of what it is monthly for their AI?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, lets do ten.

Good.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Right? Yeah. Well, thats kind of what Ive done, is kind of from my marketing.
