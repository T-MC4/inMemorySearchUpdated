But either way, I know youre working and its late and I dont want to take up your time, especially if youre in North Carolina.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"So I kind of got discouraged. But throughout the years, my love for design was really my passion at the time. And Im sharing all this with you because its refreshing to talk to you and to hear the way you feel about wanting to help people, because thats important to me. I feel the same way.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, good. Because as you get older, you want to stay focused, and its harder to stay focused. And I just think that I would probably just look at everything. It made me open my eyes to different things that I have. It would just be a matter of kind of deciding which way I want to go, which one it is.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"There you go. The reason I ask go ahead. I didnt mean to no.","metadata":{"fillerID":16,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Theres a lot going on and I think that Im a little too premature for your program still because I need to have the vehicle of what I really want to do and hopefully in the Sake Week course that Im with these guys, theyll be able to help me.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Let me see if I can yeah, Ill take a look at it and see.","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Sounds good. Okay, Ill tell you what I think well do. Im going to get through the eight weeks now, itll be seven.

That would be good too.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"And what I want to do? Really?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"There we go.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"And then when you asked me to fill everything out, I was like well, the consultant thing would be the best thing to put at this time because I was in the finance industry as well and got out of that when COVID hit like everyone else. But some of them stayed in it, which is fine, but thats not my passion and 30 some years of design business. So I wanted to kind of lead into offering accessories or something online and I kind of wanted it. Thats what I want to do. And that may not even be what you can help me with. And so thats why I inquired because I thought maybe this will be something good when I get this. And I dont know if you take startups or new business we do where Im going with this. Rick I have such a passion and a good eye for design, but what the whole industry lacked for many years was really quality high ticket accessories, from sculptures to fine art. So thats kind of what I want to do, what Im leaning into.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Youre touching upon things that I also did.

Ive actually taken both of their programs before.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I never gave it thought like that. Like I said, I put passion things that I would do and if you love what you do, the money is going to follow prior to that. Its funny that you say youre in the insurance. Were you doing life insurance or medical insurance?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Im so glad you said something, because I was ready to hang up, and I thought, like I said, you get so many calls. Yeah, I cant tell you how many I get.

Im happy you shared this information with me. What is it that I need to click on or to see?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So what type of businesses do you target to supply, to sell the program, to offer your program to? Yeah, what are some of the main yeah, because there may be something there that I may be able to incorporate with.","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"I do because actually and Ill share something else with you. Im currently involved only because it caught my attention and Im currently involved. I just signed up for a program with Dean and Tony Robbins and Matthew McConaughey. Theyve got which has been really exciting and great. Im doing that right now. Actually. I had one of the trainings today with Dean, which is pretty nice because I needed it. Its like an infusion of good energy and thats exactly what I needed because Ive been from the loss of my mom, its been like one thing after another and like I said, I put my life on home and so now Im getting rid of all that. But now its like, I like this, I like that. This is the reason this wont work yet. Yes, I can use some help on my end.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I didnt, actually. I was on my phone and I clicked on it and at the same time, when I did the same thing, nothing was really happening. And I was expecting to speak to someone or hear a video of some sort.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, okay. That makes me feel better, too.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Im 68, and thats why Im getting them all. They call me for Medicare.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I kind of put some numbers together with doing the art thing, and I know I would have reached seven figures kind of in that area. But you know what? Like you said, you got to love what youre doing. And thats something I think would be wonderful. But again, if theres something that is more easy, where you dont have to, where its a numbers game and you dont have to you kind of led me to a new direction when I asked you, what do you do? And I heard that you do all these other things because the consulting or coaching would probably be easier and better, where you dont have to rely on inventory and delivery of goods and that kind of stuff. And because its digital, yeah, it kind of got me going in a new direction. Thats the best thing I could say. And once Im taught, I could probably do ebooks too, on this, because I think we all have parents or parents that we lost or someone that we love. And its like theres so much help needed in that area, even on emotional support, if you did nothing physically to help them. Or I have a lot of friends that said, I just couldnt do what you did, where they just put everything on hold. But were all different unique individuals for sure. I feel good that I did that with my mother. Im happy. And its just that I learned a lot of things that go on that need improvement. So I can even do an ebook. I thought of at the time of doing a book on everyone that has someone thats elderly. These are the things youre going to have to face. These are the things you should know and do look into. I mean, I just thought of putting something together.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Did you ever market UnitedHealthcare?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Would you feel you its funny because the only thing thats held me back, I went through a phase where I had someone in my mom, actually she had a massive stroke. So I put my life on hold and kind of took care of her because I didnt want to put her in a nursing home. And I was blessed that I had her down 93. But what it lacked so much of that I learned from experience looking after my mother was that would fit the health and wellness that I would love, because I kept thinking thats very close to my heart. So thats something that I want to do. But as far as a passion, I shared that first with you. The negative to that that I dont like about it is sometimes you have to depend on an artist to deliver. Or if I have a manufacturer thats making this for me, I have to depend on someone. And a lot of times to keep the cost down, its outside the country. So then you have to depend on delivery. So I could sell you, lets say, a fine art piece or accessory, and then if it doesnt come in on time, that affects my income. So those are the reasons, the fears, why I kind of held back and didnt start that because my mom passed three years ago, or, excuse me, five years ago. I keep forgetting that. COVID sure messed us up, didnt it? We lost two years of that. So I have to have a couple of years there. Then, for myself, I had some horrible experiences with a couple of doctors that been healthy my whole life. And then I wound up going to see a couple of doctors and just was very one in particular was very unhappy. I mean, just couldnt believe it. Just some of the things that I experimented and experienced me, and I thought, boy, that needs to be touched upon. Our whole healthcare industry is just I dont know. But anyway, so thats what made me and I dont need to get into all the details of it, but more importantly, theres such a big need for improvement in the healthcare industry as well. And so the health and wellness, I like that when you brought that up, because thats something that would be good. And I kept thinking how I would love to put a book together. Then I thought of here comes my design experience. And my mother was I had her manicure and pedicure lady come to the house and do her hair. And we have trouble doing her pedicure feet because shes laying down. She had a stroke, so she cant really move 1ft. And then its hard to do someones feet while theyre in bed because theyre in enough position where they need to. So I designed a hospital bed that can be actually a home care bed, where when your loved ones are at home and theyre in their own home, and if they want to have the services that they had when they used to go out and get them done, which they cant now, they can still do that and be comfortable with it. I dont know. Theres a lot of things thats the creative side of me, but theres a lot of things that during COVID I sat back about, okay, this isnt going to last forever. What can we do to get back into it? But Im not tech savvy, so the online stuff and my friend said, youre so talented, you can get someone to help you with the technical part of it, right? Follow your dreams. And I said, yeah, but then again, Im depending on someone because when we were doing the financing, same thing. I had a tech guy, and then he moved I think he moved to Colorado, actually. And he was so incredible and so fast, and hed explain everything. And I caught on, and I was able to do things, but he set everything up for me. So then now that hes gone, then we had the same company that I hired him through. They sent me someone else, but they couldnt follow how he set it up. So then they made changes. So then it was like re educating yourself and frustration. And then COVID hit. And then I thought, you know what? Our industry, we were doing personal business, not personal excuse me, business loans for customers. But either way, I dont want to bore you with all this, but Im happy that you touched upon these other things. And then Ive got 35 years of design, interior design work. I used to flip homes at a young age. I bought a lot of real estate, sold it. So theres different areas where I can probably use your services.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im glad you called. I was curious because Im still not comprehending what you do. Okay. And Im not tech savvy, and that could be why it sounds like everythings online. But what was your name to begin with? So I know who Im talking to.","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"I wouldnt be today right now, but its something I will be in your future, so I wouldnt be able to do it today. The ad just caught my attention on YouTube, right. And I got to see a little picture of the kids involved. I call them kids. Theres a few people that arent kids, but I thought, let me see what this is, because it would be something that I can inquire about, get information and see if it would fit what I want to do. And Im glad I talked to you. And what is Deans role in this? Im seeing a picture of him on here now. Dean Grazio.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You have integrity, thats what it is and thats what people lack today in this world. The reason I asked you I didnt mean to pry into your health insurance, but just to tell you I was a licensed agent as well. And the reason I was is because I met my husband at the time who was at his company. Actually, Ill tell you a little story. He was part owner in UnitedHealthcare many years ago, he and Ron Jensen. And then my husband, when I met him, he retired from that company. And then I was decorating and doing projects all over and then he wanted to start an insurance company. So therefore I said, how am I going to coach and train people if I dont know anything about health insurance? Thats why I learned it. And so I learned the industry, but learned that. But I wound up decorating and Im sure you heard a pioneer life insurance out of Peter Noward. Yes, he was with our company as well. He was one of the under, I guess not the underwriter. Is that what I want to call him? Yeah, he wrote, actually, our policy I forgot, its been so many years ago. Youre going back now in the 80s. Im going back in the 80s, but just to tell you, I traveled all around the country decorating our offices and stuff for our company and then, sadly enough, my husband passed away a year ago, last year. But we divorced many long time ago. Its just that Im just bringing up some of that that I was involved in back then. I had such a passion to help people and things were so different because to everyone then, when I was learning about the health insurance and the money involved, they just cared about numbers. And its sad to say, but they just cared about numbers how much volume you did. Because we used to take our top marketing reps and agents on vacations to Switzerland, to Cancun, to Hong Kong, wherever they wanted to go. We had these contests and stuff. But anyway, so I learned a lot. And when youre involved with masses of people like that, not only do you learn a lot about the industry, but you learn a lot about people in general. And it kind of saddened me because everybody, all they cared about was the money. They didnt care about the quality of not quality, but integrity of selling the program. Like, if I went to write you the plan, and I know you had preexisting conditions, but I put that youre in excellent condition. And then later to find out he got his advance commission, but yet you called and you were upset that you were rejected, that you cant be a part of the company, just things like that. All the little things.","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"And so Im working on I signed up for that course and Im hoping that they could kind of help me with that to decide okay. Which way to go. Actually, Ill decide, but make yeah, sounds.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}}]
