But like I said, Im really just trying to how can I say this? Im always creative in my resources. When I work for other people, Im trying to do the same thing, but go on. Im sorry, I dont mean to keep going.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Hello?","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I mean, realistically, lets put it to you like this, and this has been years ago and before COVID I came into an organization, a hospital. They were in trouble. And in what I did, a partner and a consultant make 10,000 in a week. And Id like to be scaling at least 40,000 in a month eventually.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I just was trying to find more information on it because Im looking at using AI software to help me with my coaching and consulting business. Im going to make a Pivot and focus more on quality consulting and executive coaching.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No, I can say its more than that. Ill honestly say its closer to 60 since Im freelancing and I was ill. See, its like you cant get a good picture of what Im making because when I say I was ill, I was not working right. But I can say pretty much most people would assume that I approximately make approximately around still six figures. But thats not enough to live on in New York City, paying for a child to go to a private college, paying for all the maintenance and things that you have to do. But I see by the time you pay all those expenses, it ends up being around 30. How about that?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I do healthcare consulting and implementations of EHR, and I do executive coaching. So I had been doing billing, which was just because it really wasnt like what I like to do. And its a big market, but a small market. So I went back to EHR, implementation and quality. Thats what Im doing now because I enjoy it. It would be a lot better market and executive coaching. I have clients for executive coaching now, and Im just trying to move back into that direction. Id rather do something I enjoy than something I hate.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right. And then the last thing recently, one of the vendors that I worked with, Im thinking, okay, well, Ill get this work, Ill get some money in. And literally it got down to the end, I started making the sale. And Im like, if its down to me and the actual vendor, then I should be doing this on my own because I dont get paid for meeting do these meetings, so I have to change what Im doing.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So in healthcare consulting, what Im going to do is, you know, the USA facts that you get from the library where they have the research, where you get the people and you find out how much theyre making. I dont want to work with any more small practices. I only want to work with medium size practices and clinics. And Ill reach out to them to see, find out their status. And at the same time, Ive already set up a bunch of posts because I do have a LinkedIn. I have a business website that I have to redo and so that they can see the content that Im creating, so that they can see that theres value in it, for instance. And Ill give you an example and then at this point, I really am going to have to also have some work Im doing. So, for instance, one of these CEOs at the major hospital in New York City. And so this lets you know I dont manage my resources well. So were all on LinkedIn. Something happened, I said congratulations, and I made one statement. You have all these people who want to kiss his butt, right? And he was like, we need to talk about it. Can you call and set up a meeting so I have resources? So LinkedIn is one place, but I need to put the content out there that gives them the value added. So theres a value proposition to say, you know what? We need help with quality. We need help with our ACO. We need help with all the compliance that were missing. We need help understanding telehealth because its making a Pivot. We need help understanding dei. And how can we make that work in healthcare more effectively? Because only 5% of the clinicians are African American and Latino. So those are the things that I work with. But I have to get the content out there, because if you dont have a content that says because people always think just like youre doing this for free, people dont. Its great to give free resources. A lot of times its a sales pitch. If you have actual value in the free content you give someone, they begin to realize that even though they may not be able to implement it, you know what youre talking about. So thats how I plan to get my clients, is work a lot with LinkedIn and also do more research on it to see how much theyre bringing in. Has there been a drop? Are there penalties? Stuff like that?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I understand what liquid income is important. Thats what I can say.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So, ideally, what I would like to do is more like when you do probability and statistics. So Im looking at at least having at least approximately ten leads a week, like, working to get ten people a week, whether Im cold calling them, they reach out to me from those leads. Hopefully, I can convert out of the ten leads, two to three leads, hopefully, but at least one, and that should be every week. The reason I say ten leads is because normally when youre working in healthcare, you normally have people want you to have time to talk to them and when they are ready. So that gives me time in the morning, time in the afternoon. No more than two a day, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"They fired them and brought me in, but I made what they made. I mean, I made over six figures, but I didnt make any money. So my point was that here they made all the money and I found that out by accident because when they got fired, they threw their invoices at me. Seriously?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, itll allow me to hire some employees first, but the second part is that Ill be able to invest, and I plan on retiring in the next five to seven years. And I want to be able to sell my consulting company because since I work for other people, its like all Ive been doing is working for other people and what I do. And then before COVID I had gotten become ill, but I also had a bad experience. And though I did all the help and all the work, I said, you know what? I need to do this on my own. And everybody I mentored is doing great salary wise. Everybodys making well over six figures. And Im like, well, if Im such a great coach and a great mentor and then my nickname at one time used to be The Fixer. I said, I need to go ahead and do this because at this point, I hate to say, Im tired of being broke. I have a kid in college, I have bills to pay, I want to invest more, and thats it.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"That makes sense. That makes sense.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. But its still challenging getting clients. Thats what I was going to say.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Right now, I must say, its really under 30, because I havent been working. Ive been doing consulting, so its up and down, and its like some months I might make 15. So I can say its been dry because I have been ill. But when Im working, I make about 10,000 a month. About anywhere from seven to ten. Sometimes a little bit more. But since I have so what does.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Hello.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Id rather not say, because thats what happened before I invested. When I say not 5000, not 10,000, but many tens of thousands of dollars, I really do have quite a bit of capital. I also have still quite a bit of things that are tied up in assets that Im not necessarily going to liquidate them all because its mainly property, land, real estate. But I do have capital thats liquid that I can do things with. What Im looking to do is I know my knowledge. So when I say this to you, and Ill just leave it like this, the company that I was hired to help the consulting firm with, when I came in the first year, my goal was to bring in $1.2 million and get rid of all the penalties. I got that in two years, I brought in $5.9 million. I know what Im doing, but Im tired of making money for other people. And thats what I do.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Sure. Because I dont have much time either, so lets go. Yeah, let me hang up here.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Im going to say that I dont have zero. No, what I actually have, but Im not going to tell anybody anymore. But I will say you could look at it that I want to go under 10,000. I dont really want to go more than 5000 to start because when I went much more, nothing happened. I have a product that I cant sell, even though they had all the wonderful things about it. I made more money when I built websites and did coaching and wrote articles and things on my own. So Im moving away from that. And thats why I was interested in your AI product. And then I can invest more once you get it in. But the thing is, I always get calls. Like I said, I had a company call me up and Im literally like, theyre saying everything I create is yours. But they also know I have a track record and Im like, I cant do that anymore, Im sorry. But, yeah, its great to make $100 an hour. Its great to make 150 an hour. But if I can make more and then bring in resources, which is what Ive done, lets do that. Thats all Im saying.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"The end, tell you exactly. Im sorry, I dont mean to interrupt you because I know youre in a trouble. No worries. Im trying to make a Pivot. Im letting go of the billing. Im trying.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Im confused. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. What I want to do is you just make a big Pivot, get press releases, focus on what Im doing, get content out, not having the resources, but also if you have that information, like, I could be more effective. Im really great at researching, but I went in and used an AI tool and I did it in something that was totally different and I saw how great it was in defining information.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"The healthcare consulting, Im just moving into It. People normally pay me anywhere from and Im saying Im subcontracting. So as a subcontractor, they paid me anywhere from 90 to 150. Im looking at thats not your business. No, I no longer want a subcontract because Ive gotten people millions of dollars. I want to just do it on my own. And thats why AI is what I need on the executive coaching at this time. Its 3000. I think I had it at 3000.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, Im not looking to spend.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Im going to be honest. My credit score used to be great. Its not that great. I understand what youre saying. I do. Have capital now because I had to sell some property. The other thing is, I invested in another franchise type business and I lost a lot of money. And so thats what threw me all off. Because when you all your resource, Im now more liquid. But I had everything tied up. So I dont really want to talk about my credit score, but I do have capital, and my credit score will hopefully be okay in a few months. But when you get tied up in a situation as I was, I now.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Right? Because when I did purchase leads, just so you know, I worked with a company that was helping me get leads. It was just never the right leads. It was a hot mess, and so it cost me a lot of money. Yeah. A lot of garbage. A lot of garbage.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Sounds good. Sounds a little bit too good to be true, but I just want to see what I could do because I started using it and it was effective in some of the other AIS, and I felt like it would be an easier way to stay on top of posting, stay on top of content, things like that.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Its going okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I do is provide impact for them. But I know AI is new, so I think were going down a road and it makes me very nervous. And what Im trying to do right now is, yes, Im going to have people invest in it, but I have to get out there my intellectual property is me and other business use it and eat it up and they win, which is kind of interesting. And I have just decided now, either I do it or I dont. And though in the end I will have a place to live, my daughter will finish college or private college, but I need to at least give it a good shot so I can be happy. Thats all Im saying here.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"At this pace, I probably wont, but I dont want to be doing that unless its something I enjoy. And so the fact of the matter is that and Ive heard like, Im listening to this and this is sounding like a sales pitch, my whole thing is that right now what Im trying to do is, how can I say get a hand on this? AI as someone whos not young. The field I was in was very young and I feel like Ive always been open to new technology. Everybodys not open to that. But the thing is, in my field, a lot of people are older. So I feel like if I can use AI to help me scale up, it will be a great tool.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No, right now Im really not bringing in money because I was ill. When I said I was ill, I was ill. It took me out for the count. I got poison, and thats where Ill leave it. And so at this point, it made me realize you almost die when you get poisoned. So you got to do what you need to do. And what Im trying to do is thats what I get my calls in, thats what I get my work in health care as well as to tell you how good of a coach I am, I had a client I hadnt worked with in 20 years. Ironically, it was right around the pivot. She found me to help her move into her next phase of her life. So Im a very good coach and mentor. Im very good at quality and compliance and health care. Thats it. Hello?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}}]
