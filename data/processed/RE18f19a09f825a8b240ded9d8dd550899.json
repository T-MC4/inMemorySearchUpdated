But when you consider these people who are using daily and theyre spending the cash to get the drugs daily, on a number of occasions, like theyll go out and breakfast, lunch and dinner, you consider if theyre treated and it costs like, $27,000 a year for them to go through treatment, as opposed to $60,000 a year for them to go to jail or whatever. A lot of times youre dealing with some sort of rehab counseling, whether through Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance, et cetera.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I have some outlines because I dont necessarily deal directly with the people that will be using the packages. Like, you would say you deal with someone who does casework, or you deal with, say, the food stamp office, or you deal with the churches and other outreach programs that might buy into the packages in order for their clients to be able to use them. So its kind of like a different step as opposed to dealing directly with the end user. Although you can do that too. It can be packaged in different ways.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"It would love to be somewhere in the $5,000 a month range, because that I could do anything with.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Its just something that would make it more feasible for me to phase out looking for my freelance jobs and looking for this. And as opposed to sending out resumes, I can send out packages about what kind of, I dont know, industrial video your location would need for your specific type of client that you get in on a daily basis, be it in college students or be they people who are older that have been on the street for a while.

And what would the fentanyl and opioid price thats really escalated, and its just like it was in the 60s. Its like were going through the same thing all over again. Its a different amount of the same sort of drug, and its really hitting hard all over North America and in Europe.

There were several neighborhoods I did that in. It could be here, it could be overseas. It doesnt matter. If you can reach people internationally now the way you can online, in addition to, say, going around and doing in person outreach, theres no limit. You can reach that many more people. And if you can reach social services agencies, which I used to work with on the regular in La county and up in San Francisco and in New York, then all the more better, because then you can work with other people that can do the same thing. I looked at the numbers and they said people that go into certain programs that deal with this, especially with the Fentanyl and Opioid addiction, that gets them off of it within six months time. It costs around $27,000 a year, but it saves almost another $30,000 a year per person. Thats cleaned up because youre saving on jail time, because the reciprocity jail time is so much less. And they get work and they get off the drugs, and they get onto maintenance, and they start working part time, full time, doesnt matter. And then theyre back in the scheme of things, and theyre back where they want to be because a lot of them eat their addiction.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Computer is acting a little slow today.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Its negligible.

So I did a lot of basically sort of like directing, only its actually teaching physical steps in addition to the direction. And one of the things I also worked on was teaching people who maybe didnt have the skills, I guess, to raise children because I was ordained as a preacher and dealing with the Praise and Praise dances and also dealing with teaching individuals how to raise their children, whether it be feeding them, clothing them properly, learning how to speak to their kids when they were being unruly, that sort of thing. And I did a lot of industrial videos and I was doing a lot of outreach for mental health in addition to that. Because when I grew up, it was the it was the time of, I guess, turning on and tuning out is what they used to call it. So were seeing a lot of that today, and I think a lot of its really relevant. And so Im trying to figure out how to bring this sort of thing to the people that didnt go back to school, the people that didnt stay in school, and trying to figure out how to do outreach because I think its seriously needed.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im still working on it. Its on the drawing board, shall we say, because literally this whole thing just popped in my head. I said, Ive done this before. I did the industrial videos. I did the outreach to schools, and I actually did some of the client outreach individually, the people who needed this sort of service.

And then, like you did, let them know, well, that text, that was AI, and its seamless and its painless, and it just helps you get the numbers up there, I guess, is what it is. Because Im totally familiar with robotics. I have no problem with it because I studied that the prompt engineering that you do in AI, which I studied and I worked on as well. Okay.

And thats in a low rise neighborhood on the East Side in Vancouver. And that has nothing to do with all the high rises that are going up there now. And I said, Are you kidding me?
