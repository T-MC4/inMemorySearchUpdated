Professional development coaching. Personal development coaching. Business growth and development coaching. I do employee organization and employee development organization, development consulting and coaching. So kind of breaking into the health and wellness coaching as well. A lot of my executive clients will come to me for problems with managing conflict or responding to the employee engagement survey that they might have conducted, and they got to take care of themselves too. So Im exploring all this coaching in addition to what I normally do.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Its just the old fashioned hustle, brother. Cold calls, accessing the people that Ive worked with over the last ten years, presentations, handing out cards, networking, going to various different events, and even hitting up old colleagues from high school, college masters programs, training programs Ive been through, et cetera, et cetera. Just a grinding.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"About ten years.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Unfortunately, its not a good time. Im actually in the Er right now, but in general, the way that I usually do things is kind of just peruse whatever is sent to me and then something Im further interested in. So if you can send the case study and those materials that you were talking about and a direct line to you, Ill reach out if its something that I want to pursue.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Business? Professional development, personal development, essentially. I dont like to call it life coaching, but at times it does become that consulting services.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Fine.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Pretty busy, but a lot less busy. In the evening or early afternoon?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Nice. I got friends and family in Phoenix, so lets do it.","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I understand how it goes. Right. I mean, youre the fisherman and then theyre the hook, right, and they close the sale. I get it. I know how it goes.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Great. Whats going on?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right, so David Goggins, right, when hes sitting down there thinking about this pull up record that he wants to and you probably heard this story if you know about him, right, that he wants to break, he just started writing some shit down. People are like, what the fuck are you doing? And hes like, you know what Im doing is Im doing the fucking math here. Right? So 14,321 pull ups. I got to do X amount per minute and in 24 hours, and then I can break this fucking record. So all I need is 7 million people. Actually, I need 7 million people to buy my $2 products. And when youre taking a look at the number of professionals that there are in the United States, there are about 350,000,000 people. 100 million of those work in a space where they want to improve. And I need just seven of those 100 million to buy my $2 product. Okay? 50% goes to taxes. The other 50% goes into my bank account. I buy free and clear everything that I need, and Im fucking out.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Id be happy to come out. Youre in Tacoma or wheres? The central office?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I was interested in that. Just looking to kind of do a little bit of this and that. Kind of get my feet wet.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No problem, no problem. And the first one is free, all right? Because I know the game as well.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Not necessarily. More like gold, silver, and other things that will probably need to be traded or bartered. Right. Charcoal.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Im recording you. I let you know. Im recording you too.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"I guess.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Awesome. All right, man. Well, thanks a lot, and good luck with your hustle.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Do this. Take care.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Go ahead, sir.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Demographic of the people that Im working with. Right. So I need to be able to target people or a demographic that can pay more so that then I can work the same or less and make more.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, absolutely. So its contrary to modern thinking, right? What we want to do is big fish. But heres the thing. Its the straw that broke the camels back. Its the snowflake that started the avalanche. And there are lots of famous businesses. For example, a famous steakhouse upstate New York. This guy became famous for giving you a ton of food for a very low price, especially during hard times, right? What he said was, were going to make very little on the profit margin, but were going to make a port in quantity. Okay? So if I dont charge $2 because people are what they are, we charge five. So it has a little bit more of a perceived value, because that happens. Pay for and get what you pay for, right? So youre not going to go get $20 steaks in a Kmart parking lot, but it could be a fucking good steak. But if I am selling steaks at $50 at a little mom and pop shop fucking, all right, steaks, lets go. So I get that. But again, I just need seven people with good advertising, good hook, whatever marketing, to just put a $5 less than a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and a legit partially written by Tatt, but with my expertise, overlaid edited and.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Thats it.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Fair enough. Now, man, were ready to go 630 on Monday. I just checked my schedule. Lets do it.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, it depends on the needs of the customer, but I like to sell coaching packages in groups of five. Typically speaking, I think it really requires a person to have ten coaching sessions spread out over. So if you think about that, thats about five months of coaching, and that allows a person to really dig deep into what they want to discover and then apply and plan for and then really for behavior change to take root at that particular point after goals are set and met and interventions and triggers are identified. So if youre taking ten times 250, thats $2,500. Plus I use an assessment, so thats a $200 assessment. So youre looking at about $3,000 per ten sessions of coaching.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So because Im cheap myself and I understand how hard it is sometimes for people to spend money on things like that. In terms of an organization itself, what I do is I offer all solutions that are still going to make me a good profit, but are within the budget of the people that I work with. So lets say I work with a small rural hospital thats got a leadership team of five and their leadership development budget for the year is $20,000. Right. I could knock out $20,000 in a day in services that I provide them now, its going to be high quality stuff. Theres going to be pre and post work materials that theyll be able to walk away with. Were talking three by five index cards that have acronyms and tips and tricks, things like that. Right. But they might not want to blow it. So instead Ill say, all right, well, Ill come talk to you for 2 hours. And Ill coach the group for three follow up sessions at 215 hours. And for that two hour talk, its $1,500. So then out of that 20,000, they only spend 5000 on me. That makes a little bit more sense. So I try not to get nos, what I offer is other options. When they say, thats a little steep. Because, again, when youre in sales, if you cant sell that, youre awesome. Thank you very much. If you go to the BMW dealer thank you, and I apologize. Im on a business phone call. If youre going in to get the X Three Im sorry, the X Six, and it doesnt work for the clients budget, then sell them the X Three right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So thats actually why Im very interested in AI software, like Chat GPT, for example, because I do not run short of ideas. What I need is someone to take my ideas, structure them into a logical pattern, and then fill in the blanks. Right. So do the work that it takes to make up to maybe 60% to 75% of the project to make it a reality. I come in, I edit, I add some of my more ideas. I get direction. Go out there, go get them, tiger. And then come back to me when its at 85. And then well redo this. Okay. So I need Doers. If you are familiar with the MBTI I need Js. Thats the fourth letter, right? Im a P, and I get energy from ideas and bright new shiny things. And theyre good. Theyre good. And I can get you 25% of the way, but you got to make up that other 75. Right? And then I had to come back and provide some supportive oversight. We work together a little bit and then boom. We close the gap and then I need someone to say, okay, before you move on to this other wonderful idea that Ive written down, lets finish this one here.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You got to have some information. I mean, in general, is it possible to, for example, like you said, pay up front? And if it is, how much is that for your lowest package? And then if it is possible to pay in the back end, do you take more than you would take normally upfront, or is it a percentage of my sales as I go?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, it depends, but I usually stick with the going rate set forth by the ICF, so thats about $250 an hour.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, yeah, but Im not going to give you my credit card number, so.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Springfield, Illinois.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. If youre sitting there in front of Chat GPT and youre prompting, its like, all right, do this now, do that. Heres my can you do that? And then you print this, copy and paste, and then I edit. And its exactly like being in the boardroom when youre the boss. Right. You got a team of people, maybe six to ten, sitting at the table with various different levels of expertise in different categories. Okay, what do you got? Okay. Boom. And then youre firing off directives, whatever, right. You work together and thats it?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"One man show.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Nothing. Okay. I have a basically defunct Facebook page. Its all word of mouth and hustle.","metadata":{"fillerID":2,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Sure.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Likewise, man. And, hey, you know what? I can provide services to you guys, too.","metadata":{"fillerID":6,"fillerText":"Totally","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, to be honest with you, man, I just want to make enough to get off the grid.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"No, hold on just a second. Just looking to find out when Im going to be released. Ill find out. All right, thank you very much.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. How do you get paid? So you help me scale my business, but then do I owe you a percentage of that or do I just buy these tools and were done? How does it work?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Im always learning, man. I know a little bit about a little bit, but I dont know everything, so Im glad were talking about that because thats exactly why I wanted to engage you folks.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You got it. Thank you. All right, so theyre just checking on me. Im going to be getting released here in a little bit, but I just didnt know when. All right, so youre still there?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. In order to do that, I need about seven to $8 million. So a little under 1 million a month for one year. Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, its speaking, consulting, coaching, training. Right. But again, its all in the realm of personal and business development, anywhere between three to five. And then of course, I have a roster of clients that consistently work with me because, again, I sell things in packages.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Increasing the price of the services.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Lets do 06:30 P.m.. All right.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"You got to learn that, you know that because for me, what I want is I want to be able to do as much as I can alone. And if I am going to sign on with someone, I just want to know the stats, the data. Whats up? How much is it? Okay, cool. Send me what I need and then boom, Ill call you back. Honestly, I dont like to fuck around, you know?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. Heirloom seeds. Wow. Water filters, things like that. Now, the likelihood of something like that happening is very low, but I just want to be able to be completely independent if necessary. But you always got to be prepared. We didnt think were going to see a pandemic and look where the fuck we are.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Not necessarily, no.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. I just bought my first seeds. Gold.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Its a mix. Its a mix. So one to two new clients per month and about a standard issue carried over three to five. Got it. Okay. But I am reaching a maximum capacity.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Are you there?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Good question. Coaching, consulting services. As well as digital products like ebooks, et cetera, for professional personal development.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Whats your cut? How do you get paid?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"No. Every millionaire or billionaire has multiple streams of income. So this is just one facet of the business. This is all passive income anyway, right? The AI is going to take care of everything. The tools are going to take care of everything. The content that I create thats digital can bring in passive income while Im still out there doing the very same process Im doing now. Right? And as I get more known and more known and more known by the Internet at large, then I can begin to command more high ticket number one clients and charge more. Right? So my speakers fee goes from $5,000 for the day to $5,000 for the keynote because my ebook is revolutionizing the World of Leadership and Emotional Intelligence. Right, got it.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}}]
