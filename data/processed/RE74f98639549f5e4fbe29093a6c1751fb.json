We have the high scale and the lower scale or medium scale. Because dealing with companies, first of all, dealing with lawyers and doctors, they think they know everything. And then the egos from a lawyer because they get quite comfortable just by the clients that they have. A lot of times we have to update the website, and then we have to speak to the we call it the Gatekeeper, which is the receptionist who thinks they know everything. Theyre not marketers. They think they know what that for there. So its a whole lot of time to get through. Then you got to speak to the tech guy who is not a marketer, and you got to kind of stroke the ego, say, hey, were not here to take your job. Were trying to assist you in here, going on. So after we get through all that, we already know were going to charge money for them.","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, good afternoon.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"It could be over 50 is better. Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, I kind of like him a little bit, although hes 30 something years old, he tells me what to do. We have a lot of doctors and lawyers, but we also in the beauty market. My wife has a beauty salon, but she does a lot of high profile clients in the fashion industry over here in New York. Okay. One of the things that were doing is building a platform for the models and the back end of production. More of a branding solution. The only platform, thats what were doing now.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yes. Good afternoon.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Every business you could possibly manage it from political standpoints, come to my wifes store, you know what Im trying to say? And sometimes she just say, hey, my son does a little bit of this or what we do in the back if we go with her. But other than that, its seriously, like word of mouth and reputation, you know what Im saying?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right?","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, we usually are kind of aggressive because a lot of people over here where we are in Jersey, usually we in places thats needed, like, say we might go to a meeting. Its usually a network. We usually just do word of mouth, you know what Im trying to say. They look at us online, you know what Im trying to say. My son does the emails and stuff like that. But over here in Jersey, its a different kind of animal. Theyre egomaniacs, and we kind of go on there on the ego. As opposed to New York, where my wife stores that we got to do like marketing, you know what Im trying to say? Over there, a lot of people pretty much were noses for being in the years of building apps. Many years ago with the app where I came out and have this, we still have a lot of our old clients refer to us through a whole lot of clients. When my wife places out, we have an office over here, my son and I. But when my wife is at, its like a melted pot for business.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No, Im partnering with my son marketing company and with the graphics part. My son has a few clients thats overseas that might be interested in some services, and I really forgot what Air AI was. Let me pull it up real quick. 1 second. Im sorry. So we get right on the same page. Yeah. Thank you for calling me. Give me 1 second.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Its pretty good. You know, what is that were not trying to go like, across the world, but let me be specific. Were not trying to broadcast all over for what we do for the entire spectrum of business. We like that. When you kind of monetize what you do best, its a lot more effective. I drive truck. Im in the truck at night and weekends. I work with my son in office and him and his crew just to tighten up on what they need to do. Or basically he tells me what to do. So were to the lawyers medical field and the beauty aspect in the teacher world. My sons for quite a few people who schools in the south, but we did all that, and its too broad. We realize over the years that you got to focus what you do best or know best, or the fields that we are in, which helps out a lot, which keep a precise point of profitability. You know what Im trying to say. We dont span up all across. It becomes too much. Its not that we can handle it. Its just this is a little more effective. When you talk the same lingo, whatever those arenas of expertise that theyre in. Does that make sense?","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Whats, like the average on the four to six month contract?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"No, you and the client, do they reach out to you? You reached out to them. Are you doing online marketing? How do you guys connect?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"But one of the last shows was that a company from over there in Asia somewhere south Asia, around there, jakara. They have a marketing not marketing company. They have a product line that they have they want to introduce in New York. So I want to come back with a different pitch, but I got to see exactly which company.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"He does a little bit.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"All right, pull me up right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":6,"fillerText":"Totally","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.
