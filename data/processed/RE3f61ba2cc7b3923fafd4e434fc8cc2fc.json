Okay, no worries. Yeah, now is not a good time. I got to jump into something right now. Can you just send me more information? And I think I requested that case study. Can you send me that and then more information, too?","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"No, I dont even think I received it.","metadata":{"fillerID":38,"fillerText":"Ummm yah","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, we dont like what that is right now for what were doing.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Do you with any business partners?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, sounds good, man.

A 30 foot?","metadata":{"fillerID":31,"fillerText":"Ummm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. So right now it sounds like just really grinding it out, doing a lot of different things with the hopes that some of this is going to convert to be able to just get people in at the high ticket level. Is that kind of what youre saying? Yeah. Tell me. Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"When did you say? 08:00 p.m.?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Marketing, digital development.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, just send me more information so.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Software obviously lower. I hear you. So it sounds like maybe theres a fluctuation in the higher ticket clients and a lot of the revenue right now theres more consistency within the software and apps and stuff, but obviously those are lower ticket. If Im off roast me. Is that kind of what youre saying, though? Thats what it sounds like, yeah, thats.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. Yeah, wed rather get customers at will using our money than our time because our time is more valuable than the money. So were trying to figure out how to do that process using disposable money instead of time. So we rely on automation or ads or technology to kind of do its thing, to do our legion instead of like having we dont have any cold callers right now. Maybe we might think of something like that in the future, but I dont know. We dont have that right now. We have lead nurture if the leads come in, but we dont have outbound outreach.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Probably like a little bit over, some under.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Ads and doing cold outreach as well, starting it up.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I didnt understand that question.","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"In monthly revenue right now, we want to be doing better is what Im saying. Were in a transition where were getting a couple more new clients, but our goals are to hit 20K months pretty soon. Were getting close to it.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. Not as much of a steady number, but we want to get back into getting a couple of clients that we can charge, like higher retainers off of, that we can go through. We want to get back to doing that because right now we have a couple we want to get to those clients that are more high ticket where we can charge what we want to be charging per client instead of having multiple clients that were only charging a couple of thousand off of.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Put the equal amount of resources capital.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Like our lead gen strategy?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Each month is a little bit different, but some like that and then some.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know what you just said. What do you say? Am I tracking it?","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"You said it was a name and then I dont know. I have no idea. I thought that you just called a different name instead of saying legion. What did you call the term?","metadata":{"fillerID":26,"fillerText":"Ummm yah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, its linked to ads.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, no worries. No, youre all good, right? Yeah, I think your goal is really solid to get the 20K consistently and take it to the next level. Sorry, but I hear you. It makes complete sense. This is my curiosity to help me more with our next call because Ill give you the short version. I think that goal is excellent. Why 20K specifically? Why that consistency number? Why is that what youre after right now?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So were an agency, so we do a couple of AI stuff, but were really trying to sell these mobile apps. So we have a SaaS mobile app software where we basically sell mobile apps. We just did a mobile app for this guy, has like a million followers on TikTok, that kind of stuff. But were really just trying to scale it out and get it out there. Cool.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Well, because a lot of the stuff that we sell is also design that are the higher ticket. So if theyre getting like a mobile app design, its almost like a website design, you know what I mean? The higher ticket cost from a design isnt the recurring, its instead just the upfront and then the SaaS option is the recurring is then like 250 a month. So thats not doing as many numbers upfront per month.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"But theres a lot of one month this, one month that.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, but not really. Youre off on the objective. The whole thing is like were waiting to find a solid one to really jump our time and resources into so that were not putting all of our time, efforts, resources, et cetera, into something thats not the best way. Because why would you want to switch everything that everybodys doing and make everybody follow one blueprint if theres a better blueprint already out there? So were not really sold on what were doing right now entirely or were kind of looking for a better avenue because when we find that better avenue, thats the one that were going to run on indefinitely.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"We have a lot underneath the hood.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Be doing ads, scaling down from the.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Ive given you a decent amount of info, so I hope that youre able to pull something from there. Yeah, for sure. I can do my due diligence before I get on the phone and do all that kind of other stuff later on. I want to make sure that check out the case study.","metadata":{"fillerID":11,"fillerText":"For sure","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Thats the reason why were going to.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So were guessing that it might be because we didnt niche down. So were creating an initiative. This initiative is one thats going to be just based in the food and beverage industry. So imagine like a digital marketing agency, software company thats only for restaurants and stuff. And were running a campaign for apps and everything else. And were making it like an application like program and thats what were going to pump ads to. And then were probably going to approve a whole lot of people to the program and then if not all of them, but were going to try to act like theres more urgency and limited availability, put the scarcity on that, that kind of stuff. And then were just going to follow up there and then hopefully going to get people in the program for that.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"It all kind of depends. Like our SAS, we have a marketing software that one goes on average, probably like 250 a month. The apps go 250 a month, too. And then we have services and obviously the design and development fees, which can go from 4K upwards to higher, a lot higher. You could have a client that youre charging like forty K a month for marketing?","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"In or what is the functionality?","metadata":{"fillerID":26,"fillerText":"Ummm yah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Im not in front of my computer. Im about to meet somebody at a place. Im going to have to go in literally like a little bit, like 1 minute theres nightmaps, so Im going to have to go.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"And thats the reason why were trying to test different strategies.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Our office is in Miami, but were obviously all over the nation. Its kind of like we take clients everywhere.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"What I mean is like a very removed it doesnt have to be in depth by any means. What I just mean is can you give me a basic view of how youre getting clients currently, how are you getting leads currently and how are you converting them into clients, if that makes sense. When I say I mean from the top of a skyscraper, could you explain briefly whats going on down there? Its going to be far removed. You know what I mean?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"In each one to see which one does better, to really try to get that down, to get it down to.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"What did you call this? I forget what you called it?","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"I have no idea. A decent amount? I have no idea. Dont even have enough.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Because.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Hey, how are you doing?","metadata":{"fillerID":27,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know what you mean by 30,000 foot.

Okay, so you have a couple of business partners. What are their roles? Because it sounds like youre kind of running the show, if thats fair to say. If Im off, tell me.","metadata":{"fillerID":18,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"That literally every single time.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I know more what you guys are doing and everything else. Because the website wasnt that formative, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Were probably just a little bit short of it. A little bit short of it.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Ten probably.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}}]
