Mike Dillard, thats another one that Ive taken. I dont know if youre familiar with him. The product launch formula, PLF is the name of his course. So I dont know what I have done, and I can send you some information. Ive owned a publishing company. Ive been in sales about 30, 40 years, and I can actually send you my book thats already weve got first seven chapters done, and its all about future proofing by pivoting your business, by recognizing some of the early signs that are out there and then being able to make changes before you get whammied rather than after. And again, its the basic idea, I guess, that Dean talks about is we all have some knowledge thats of some value to somebody. Its a matter of packaging it and identifying the people that can benefit, that are willing to pay money for the seminar. Jeff Walker thats an email I was trying to think of. So your specialty is helping people package and sell their seminars. Is that correct? Hello?","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"May have.
