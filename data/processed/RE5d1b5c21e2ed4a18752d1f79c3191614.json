Yeah, I think thats one of his offerings as far as the click funnels are concerned. The other thing is the process of bringing somebody into your organization who looks at your particular ad, and then a number of people who go from looking at it to actually showing up for a conversation about what you have. And then from that point, thats the show rate. And then from there, youve got the close rate of the people who actually decide to pay you for your services. You got to look at those numbers. What are those percents? Is it 80%? Is that good or is that bad? Is the closing percentage 15%? Is that good, or is that bad? How do I improve it if its not the way it should be? I mean, there are a number of different things that you need to be almost have an expertise in to do well. Or partner with somebody who already knows how to do this kind of stuff. That can just show you how to do this stuff. So the other thing is running ads? What ads do we run? Where do we run ads? How much do we pay for ads? Which ones are performing properly. How do we monitor the performance of the ads? These kind of things as well. Kind of go into a successful business. And then the other thing that a lot of people dont think about Dan, is when you have an offering, regardless of what it is, like you said, if youre teaching the affiliate marketing or if youre coaching somebody on real estate or whatever you decide to do. Basically, the people who show up to have a conversation with you, if 20% of those people actually buy, then the other 80%, where do they go? How do you keep track of them to reach back out to them? Because they showed interest. They just didnt buy. So they are potential clients that a lot of people just let go. They never go back out after them. So its having a plan to go back after those people also again huge.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"All right.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Im good.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I got two or three things I checked my credit on.
