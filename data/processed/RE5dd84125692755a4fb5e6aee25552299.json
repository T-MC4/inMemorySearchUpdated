I just probably need, like, a minute.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Thats what I need help with, because I really do not think that that should be screenwriting at all. The reason is our business is very specific. They dont really think that people should really be charging that much unless youre a super famous showrunner, and then theyre already rich, so they dont do courses unless theyre doing, like, master class or something.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know. Probably, like, $1,500.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Hi. Sorry.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Hello?","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So what that is, is I have a background in education. I do not want to be a teacher ever, but I dont mind doing courses and stuff like that. I do have a masters in that. I am a writer, a screenwriter, and I also have been very successful writing comic books for companies and, like, won one golden pen. Actually, I won three awards last year. I did it for a nonprofit with my art team. And so some people have suggested that maybe we should be doing something like that. But Im really good at coaching, and so maybe I should do that. So Im just trying to figure out what I can do with my skill set, and then how can I turn that into a business that allows me to make enough money so that I can build my production company, basically. Thats it.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"45 days? I would have to look at my account. Most likely, yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"That sounds pretty good.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I literally do not want it that badly, where I would be, like, living in a homeless shelter, possibly in danger.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Im not up to anything coherent at this very moment.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.

I honestly was interested in whatever this is is because I wanted to know, figure out that mystery of what I could coach or make courses around. That was my initial interest.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"And it goes.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So the first name is Theophilus, which is the name of the man who is the real Mad Hatter Theopoulos. And so its Theopoulos films.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"To be honest, not a lot, because I live in Los angeles.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Right, okay. So its just that foundational call or whatever, and then the actual coaching itself. Is that what youre talking about? Those two things.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I mean, if I can make that, yes, I would want to focus on that, and then the filmmaking part would need to be more, but I would be free to begin to build that.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Im talking to you.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"So I could probably pay, like, 1500, maybe 1000. But its just because things are different than this is why my business is terrible. Its like things shift all the time. Like, Im going to get $100.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"To shoot it to the moon?","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No, youre not wrong.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Its available once my deal comes through, yeah, probably.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, possibly.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"You mean ask somebody for money if.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"That would be great if its really true.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I would like it.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"I can pay my rent, but to.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I do not by accident, accidentally invest a certain amount of money and put myself in a worse situation because Im in a very shaky situation at this point. Just due to no one else contributing in my household and me taking one.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"I dont understand. Say I only have $500 to invest. Is it even like Im just in a weird situation. Like I told you, if I knew about this coming up, then I would have $1,000, $1,500 for sure. I would give it to you to start, but right now its like out of the blue. So is it even worth me talking to these guys if I cant even deliver at this point?","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"It depends on what I have to initially invest. If its viable for me right now, I would love some type of suggestion on how I could at least save up to start. I dont want to do this, but I dont want to throw it out just because I dont have the money right at this moment. Thats what Im right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"It depends. I dont know what it would entail. I dont mind managing people. Thats easy for me. But the time part would be weird, so I would have to see.","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Thats insane to me, because for me, I was just like, oh, I just need to make 20 grand a month, and Ill be able to live my life, and I can build myself giving investors and that kind of thing.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"To be honest, I would rather start with an investment, a financial investment and then see if it works out rather than doing things on credit.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"25K equals filmmaking.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No, I didnt need it. Saving it.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. I know. I dont know if you understand right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, Im pretty good at my appointment. I just want to know I just basically need to know financially what this means for me right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No, Ive been striking with a writer skill.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"That just sounds like those kind of people wouldnt even want to talk to me, but okay, well, just so you.","metadata":{"fillerID":16,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. I mean, I hope thats true, because I know how sales works. Ive done sales once. I dont like it.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"I see what youre saying. Like, if I needed to pay my rent, Id probably ask somebody for money. So pretend like this is and if.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"To be honest, I did the job with my art team, and they won the award. It wasnt like we werent given credit. Of course we were, but the comic itself won two digital marketing awards, I guess, because they published it as a digital comic.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"What do you mean? The price? Not being able to pay my rent?","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, but I mean, I basically told you that I dont have a specific business and they are still going to be able to talk to me. Absolutely.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Lets see. Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"What is tomorrow? Saturday.","metadata":{"fillerID":30,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"I have no idea. I dont know.","metadata":{"fillerID":31,"fillerText":"Ummm","category":"E"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, listen.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Its just because Im the only one paying here, and no one contributes anyway. Sorry. Im alone, so I can say things. I would say its probably depends on.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Everything else is gravy. If Im making that okay, I am happy right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know. Right now, I get leads just from something like upwork or people that I know. Right, okay, thats it.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I won a golden pen, and then I won two other digital marketing ones, and then Ive won another one called a glyph award just for my own individual comic. So Ive done that. And then Ive won some tiny placing contests for screenplays. And I also ghost wrote some international TV shows that went on to win awards for these people that took credit for thats.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Sure.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I would not spend that money right at this moment until my deal comes.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Next week. I just have to sign a contract and they start paying.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I dont even know.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Not really.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Its terrible. I really dont know. I dont know because I literally just cut a deal yesterday, and its just very stressful for me. But I think maybe.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"I have, yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":18,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"I know, but I just want to be able to think about it without someone else filling my head and telling me how to do it. If you say this, give me these ideas, and then I go off and say, let me figure out where I can find that $1,500. Because typically, say I need rent money, what I typically do is reach out to old clients and overload myself with work. So instead of driving Uber or something like that, Ill just go do some kind of script editing or do some kind of, like, edit somebodys novel for a smaller amount of money than I normally charge and have extra work, and then I would be able to come up with the money. But I have to.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"It was in the 500, and I would be surprised if its over 700. Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":2,"fillerText":"Yah gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I mean, I just got this deal, and the deal was not what I wanted it to be. And then my other deal, thanks to the rider strike, is actually frozen. So I would have had way more like I would have had, like, ten K, maybe 15K.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, hi. I thought you were calling tomorrow.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Right?","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I said discontinue.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Hi, Billy. All right.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I would have to sit down, but I think.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Lets see. What would I be doing in the sales appointment? How long would it be?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Right now?","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"It is cool.","metadata":{"fillerID":18,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, got you.","metadata":{"fillerID":1,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"It is so true.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Like, deal me down this last week, I said, yeah, I would take a job for 1500 instead of 25,000 instead of 25,000. And so because I did that, because Im like, I can deal with it, I can figure it out. I have less to play with.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I dont even know. I just did my taxes too. I dont know. Like 65 or 75K.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Who would these people be? What would it be?","metadata":{"fillerID":28,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"D"}},{"pageContent":"Im not willing to do that, but I dont want to drop the coaching thing that easily because Im actually really good at coaching. So I would something that I have a skill at rather than something that I dont. But again, the marketing thing, I could probably do that too. It just depends on what it involves.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I do.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Right.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Right, I know that, but I would rather not have that weird pressure on me, and I wont want to listen as much in the meeting. Ill feel weird in the training because Ill feel that pressure. If I feel comfortable, then I will.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I have it right now, but I dont want to spend it, to be honest.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, wow.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Hey, well see if I can do that since people just came home. But I will do it. I will try.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah. Im not, like, a person who has time to just be on sales calls, because I literally am a creative, and Im literally writing books and movies all the time, and I have to be left alone when Im working.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"You do get started next week. I dont understand the difference.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"No, I just mean, like, the script. Theyre like, well, you have to say this and that. So Im just like, yeah. I dont know if you really believe.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I want to do it, but I still want to be able to okay, lets do it. That other thing first. I dont see why thats a problem and why I cant wait five days. I know you have to close, and you have to get me not to go away forever, but I feel like.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"When opportunities like this come and I say I dont have money or whatever, and then I get, like, say, this documentary feature that I was supposed to get earlier this year and they come through in July. Then if I know its something that I want to do. I will take part of that money and make sure I dont need it and then invest it in something like this. Whereas if I dont know about this, Im going to say, you know what? Im not going to work in month four so I can work on X, Y and Z something else, and then that money will be occupied. So thats why its like, well, I dont have the money because I said yes to a certain contract, because Im basing it on what I thought was coming. And this is. Out of the blue. So therefore, I dont have the money, but I could if I had time.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know, sales funnel or something.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I dont, but I would try to make one that sounds like something I would like to have in place.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I guess you guys think people will drop off or something, but Im not like, that.

Thank you, Daniel.","metadata":{"fillerID":5,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I mean, its just that people just came home. They always start talking, but I can.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"So thats the other thing off. My room is going.","metadata":{"fillerID":17,"fillerText":"wow","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Im willing to do what it takes.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, I see. Just doing that. So just like the intro.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I have no idea. Its probably a lot, but I have no idea.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Are you able to call me back tomorrow or save this for next week so I have time to figure stuff out? I just dont like being doing stuff without planning. I just dont like to heres the thing, it makes me nervous.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"The uncomfortable part of it is the fact that the training I dont mind training. I always show up to my appointments. If I say Im going to do something, I do it, unless theres an emergency, and that really happens. Its just that I dont feel comfortable if Im being forced to give money, because right now, it is really embarrassingly difficult for me right now. And its like out of the blue, asking me to give something. I literally just paid $300 for something small last month from something with my script writing whatever, and I hadnt planned to do it. And that tiny amount of money made the month it was two months ago. It made the next month super difficult, and it was just $300. And its like, if I do that again with $1,500, yeah, okay, maybe I could play around and figure it out. But honestly, Im probably lying to myself saying that I could actually spare that money because I lied to myself with $300, and it bit me in the butt. So thats the reason. I do not have money like that, and I wish that I did, and thats why I want $25,000, because I want to be able to do stuff, but I need something in between that to get me to a place where I have 1500 I can spare.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"I have to do a script outline because Im non union.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Thats what I was thinking of doing. Or Im like, oh, should I just publish books on KDP and start making money? I was just trying to figure out a way to have to be stable to live my life, because the stability that I need to be honest, to be really honest, I need to make $25,000 a month to be stable, to live in Los Angeles.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I guess I would have to do it, but I would just basically be like, oh, I cant pay my rent one month. Seriously? Thats what I would be in the situation.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. Im not Tony Robbins. But, I mean, Im just saying Im not like that. Im literally an artist. So I dont know.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, it would take me 2 hours.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I used to do that, but I dont have my car because I cant.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"I would like you. Im telling you my answer. Within the film industry itself, I do care. Other industries, I dont care. In the film industry, I care because its all about reputation. Its all about who you know. Its all about all these kinds of things. So you have to maintain a certain image and a brand, and my brand in particular is a certain thing. So I have to not be Joey Tuccio. I love Joey Tuccio, but he basically has, like I dont want to use him because I really like him, but a lot of people have these businesses where theyre feeding off his screenwriters hopes and dreams, and I just dont think that thats where I want to be because they end up just doing that. They dont end up becoming filmmakers. They never do. Ive never seen it. Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Working. I have to work.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"On the calendar I know what but Im saying you salespeople because Im a creative and all of my time is spent creating. I do not like to be interrupted. Anyway, so I was saying, thinking about taking up a lot of time doing that is, like, almost foreign concept to me. So Im thinking I would maybe be able to do 25. That would be a lot that I would be able to do something like that. Its just that I a month, right?","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay. So obviously I have a lot of different trajectories in a sense, but my general trajectory is screenwriter, producer, theopoulos Films.
