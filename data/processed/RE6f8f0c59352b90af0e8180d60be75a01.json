Im a musician, so I make money. And I make about $1,400 a month from the church as our church organize that and whatever I can get coming in for now for the marketing.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, its being worked on right now as we speak, but its under 600. But Im getting my feedback from it, my points, getting certain points each week coming up. Its getting better.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, about a week before I stopped doing that, I said about two weeks. One of the principals came to me because she knew what I can do, because every morning we let the kids in off the bus. We have metal detectors and all that. We would talk while were doing that. I had a marketing company. She knew I had a media company and she seen my photography work. She wondered why was I working there and not doing my own thing. The whole three years I worked there, she kept on asking me that. She seen my graphic designs. I do 3D graphic, I do videographic, I do whatever. I never went to school for any of it. I just started doing it. Shes seen the video, shes taking pictures, graphics. So when the day came to where the school, something happened that wasnt completely my fault. I went for on a call and the call was already taken care of that nobody told me and I went after it was taken care of to take care of it. When I entered the office, nobody said a word to me before I approached the student about the situation. The student pretty much they cant have phones or anything. So I tried asking for his phone and they fell to the ground. And next thing I know Im getting hit on the back. So I stand up, he comes at me. So basically Im had to defend myself and then he tackles me. I said Im like time I was like 280 and hes a little 14 year old. He actually tagged me, pull my leg from running me like a UC fighter. Woods. I said okay, and I was into martial arts. I took him down along with me and pushing into the wall and held him as I did. But when the police officer came handcuffed him, the boy headbuttered them. And then the police officer ended up hitting the boy while the handcuffs but they had to cover that up. So I got to blame for initiating the whole thing and put me on leave for a whole week, ten days during spring break. But prior to that, a week before that happening, the lady that I worked with, shes in the business also, and she wanted to learn the AI stuff and some other stuff. So she gave me two websites. She said, I want to do this, but I know you already into this kind of stuff, so if you learn this, I will be your customer, I hire you to do my stuff. And so thats basically how I got back into it. And that was like two weeks prior to me leaving that job. Since Ive been since I left it, I just got to looking through all my work since I left it, and I had to scroll down my page, my platform that I use about 25 times to get to the back to the top of the list from all the work Ive been doing on it. Ive been doing a lot of advertising, and I got everything put together within a month time, I completed a whole marketing system, everything. And I also have a partner that hold on a town every day.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I know some of the things that I do and know how to do and all the packages that I offer, and I know what the minimum price for that package is. And combined with my wife, my wife is also a clothes designer. She designed scratch. Im looking at how much her clothes would cost when I start marketing her. Im looking at the stuff that already my past, what I was capable of making from the past, from what I were doing, and the sales part of it. And then I know how to merchandising and marketing if I was a manager at Dollar General, and Walgreens pretty much know how to do the business for us. Now I just calculated how much I need to sell each day to get to what I want each week by the time I get to the month. If I dont make the 10,000, be half of that, Id rather see higher than what I can get.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I had $5,000, put it that way. But for my rent for the last two months, I had to pay two months of rent so far, plus the food and everything. So they pretty much brought me down to hardly anything right now. Thats why Ive been doing marketing the way Ive been marketing lately.
