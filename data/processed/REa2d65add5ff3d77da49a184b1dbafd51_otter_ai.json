Yeah, its just me. But I do know that it takes time to build the program, and I think thats been the biggest hesitant, because I still see clients, and I was like, okay, I got to be able to build out a program that and it seems like a huge amount when I think about it.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"So we have an ecommerce store thats online, and then we have two brick and mortars.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Oh, wow.","metadata":{"fillerID":4,"fillerText":"wow","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"One of our locations well, I mean, this is service based, but one of our locations does about 50,000 a month, and we want to make more.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Oklahoma City.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I could be able to teach other estheticians more so ones that are already in the field.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I see.

Ive been in the industry for a long time.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Well, that wasnt the reason. Thats why I was like, let me ask and see. Because the more I was looking at it, I was like, I dont know if that was because I was looking for more so marketing to be able because our Dallas location is a new location. So I was kind of looking for ways to be able because I did a little kind of intro bought this intro class for AI, and weve talked about it briefly in our industry about different automations for, like, if people go to our website being able to scan the face and be able to make recommendations on what type of cleanser, what they need, and it could be able to refer our product line. But that just seems so like, I wouldnt even know where to go to even plug something like that in. But it started popping up on my Facebook. So thats how I found you since Ive been doing some of this marketing stuff and different AI things, thats when you popped up, I was like, let me see if this is something that I could do. But then after I read a little bit, I was like, oh, I dont know. I dont know if that fits what Im trying to do at this moment. But I was like, it was definitely worth me being able to see if theres any opportunity.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I see.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, Im definitely very passionate about what I do. So like with skincare, I wanted to open up a school, but I decided that I wanted to put my business in a larger market. I thought about possibly franchising out what I have. Ive thought about different ways to teach other professionals thats in my field. How Ive been able to grow successfully over the years, the model. Because I get people about mentorships all the time that know what Ive done. Of course, nowadays its all about followers. So somebody sees somebody with a bunch of followers, they want them to coach and train them and Im like, well, they was able to attain followers, but you dont know their history or their background. Sure, but Ive thought about it. Ive thought about being able to have another streamline of income that could offset definitely when the brick and mortars arent doing as well.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Yes.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.
