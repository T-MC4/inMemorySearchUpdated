I dont know if they still do it now, I have been there in a minute, but anyway, so my kids made fun of me. Oh, mom, those attacky flamingos. So from there, this whole funny thing has been created. And they would give me dishes, and my family went nuts, and my friends went nuts and bought me all these different types of flamingos. So I kind of created this character called Filamena flamingo, and I just sent away to the printer a print for my wall becoming Filamena. Its a flamingo and its becoming Filamena.
