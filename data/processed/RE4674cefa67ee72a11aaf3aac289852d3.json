And that would be without any additional services. That would just be straight commission, which is the agency traditional integrated media commission. 15% on digital, though. Some digital campaigns, I charge a pure 20%.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"53. But Ive been doing it a long time.

I mean, I dont have a clear understanding of exactly what youre talking about. But sure, yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Most people that are in the industry, certainly in the area that Im in, know that Im an independent media planner buyer, so when they have needs that arise, they refer business to me or they bring it to me and we do a share on the commission. Thats pretty much it in a nutshell, other than clients that I work directly with and how they find me is always through referral.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Off of budget, placed.","metadata":{"fillerID":36,"fillerText":"Yah umm","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Yes, thats correct.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Because it just depends on what accounts are at hand, whats billing, and if theres a share with another agency or something like that.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.

So when I look at my daily projections, which I do every day, its a list right now, as of today, of, lets see, 25 active clients right now this month with 123456, with ten in the futures category. So sometime this year.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"825.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Since 1990.","metadata":{"fillerID":40,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"But no.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Regardless, I dont have anything designated for that.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, not right now.

It goes up and down, but we bill probably a few million a year. Its just me, one person? No, thats annual annually.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"15% of media build plus.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, since 1996 I have, but in 1990 I worked for a sports marketing PR firm and just decided that media buying was what held the most power in an agency and was in the most demand. So I went into it, and its been non stop ever since.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Sometimes they bill 20 a month, sometimes they bill 200,000 a month or more. 300,000.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"To get customers at will? No.","metadata":{"fillerID":45,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Idea, I dont know, 510 thousand?

Its excellent.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"That call with the consumer, try to watch it. Its just two and a half hours is a long video to watch, a lot of time to dedicate to something. I dont know. Ill be happy to give it a try, but its 02:00 now. Thats 24 hours from now. Im just getting back from vacation. I cant guarantee that I will try.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Thats my Id like to hear more about it.

Okay?","metadata":{"fillerID":43,"fillerText":"Ok yah","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Call me. And I would think that next Wednesday or Thursday would be better, but I cant cram it in this week. Im so sorry. Okay.","metadata":{"fillerID":39,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"F"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah, I mean, ultimately, I would like to have a formula where its like, okay, I have 33 markets and they spend 50,000 a market. I make 15% off of that. That yields me almost 3 million a year. Yeah, that would be nice. On a consistent basis, that would be very well right.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know. It doesnt really go that way. But if you want to say how many per month, I get one to three new clients per month. But sometimes theyre projects, sometimes theyre clients that stay for ten years. It just depends.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I dont know. I dont really understand.

Yeah, no, I can on Thursday. I can on Thursday. And I cant on Thursday. Im just overloading, I feel like, just kind of cramming it in a little too much, and Im not leaving myself enough time to get my actual work done, which I need to go because I have deadlines that people are literally Ive gotten, like, four phone calls while weve been talking. So I would say, call me back and lets see if we can get it. Call me back next Tuesday, and if we can get it scheduled for Wednesday the 19th, we can do it then.","metadata":{"fillerID":15,"fillerText":"Gotcha","category":"B"}},{"pageContent":"Okay, sure.","metadata":{"fillerID":42,"fillerText":"Ok gotcha","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"Correct.","metadata":{"fillerID":22,"fillerText":"Okay","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"No, I dont.

No. It comes in the form of 3300 for one client, 7500 for another client, 1500 for another client. It just depends on what their 15% is of their budget that Im placing for them.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Not very often. Most people come to me with a budget already.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"I enjoyed it. Its always good. Yeah. And I do a fair amount of work in Orlando as well.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"No, look, because Ive been on the phone almost 40 minutes now, okay, you piqued my interest.

I would say that about 25 a month.","metadata":{"fillerID":9,"fillerText":"Interesting","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"Place and the reason why I would rather move it at this point, I dont want to do it tomorrow.

Whereas if I have things that are like, okay, this is the program. This is how it works. This is the amount you need to spend. Yes, you qualify. No, you dont qualify. Okay. And build that up to 33 markets on annual buys, then I can have a lot more free time and a lot more money.","metadata":{"fillerID":10,"fillerText":"Definitely","category":"A"}},{"pageContent":"I dont really book appointments. I normally just have people call me and then I roll.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Well, of course.","metadata":{"fillerID":21,"fillerText":"Yeah","category":"C"}},{"pageContent":"I would say thats not really how my business works, but I dont really set appointments and do that right now.","metadata":{"fillerID":46,"fillerText":"Uh-huh","category":"G"}},{"pageContent":"Yeah.
